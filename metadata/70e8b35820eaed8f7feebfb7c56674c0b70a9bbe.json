It contains an installer (APK) to copy additional resources to the PokeDroid app, found here. All pokemon-related apps are being removed from the Google market in compliance with a DMCA complaint by The Pokemon Company inc, but this would otherwise be free.\n\n\nFROM THE AUTHOR'S SITE:\n\nThe perfect app for either the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©maniac whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gotta catch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“em all or the Gen-Y hipster trying to be ironic. It started out as something of a joke app, since the main feature was that it used the Android TTS engine to speak aloud each PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©monÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s description, similar to the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dex in the TV show. Now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more of a full-on strategy guide, with lots of detailed info for PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon gamers. Supports generations three through five.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e8b35820eaed8f7feebfb7c56674c0b70a9bbe","amp;dn":"Pokedroid+Extras+%28Android+.apk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e8b35820eaed8f7feebfb7c56674c0b70a9bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,232,179,88,32,234,237,143,127,238,191,183,197,102,116,192,183,10,155,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
