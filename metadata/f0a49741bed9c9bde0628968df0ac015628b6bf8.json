The Feller-Buncher, which is used to cut down trees, can process 1,000 trees a day. The Dangle Head Processor cuts, strips and slices wood in less than a minute, while the Log Loader adds organization to the chaos by stacking logs. But prior to jumping into these massive vehicles, Richard must scale a tree like a true lumberjack and learn how the Luoto family maintains their sustainable forest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0a49741bed9c9bde0628968df0ac015628b6bf8","amp;dn":"Richard.Hammonds.Crash.Course.S01E02.Tree.Harvester.HDTV.x264-No","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0a49741bed9c9bde0628968df0ac015628b6bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,164,151,65,190,217,201,189,224,98,137,104,223,10,192,21,98,139,107,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
