Well now I've made a VMware Image for you all to try without having to install it on a PC. There hasn't been a huge UI overhaul, but there are new features, so don't go expecting a completely different look just yet. There's a shortcut to take you to a tutorial of how to setup the VM if you're unsure, and the correct VMware to run the image is provided. Mac VMware is also included for those Mac users, enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45dc7fd5fb6f75a7aed765eb86f1769f46602894","amp;dn":"Windows+8+%5BBuild+7980%5D+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45dc7fd5fb6f75a7aed765eb86f1769f46602894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,220,127,213,251,111,117,167,174,215,101,235,134,241,118,159,70,96,40,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
