Like Arch and Gentoo it does not have fixed releases, but can be continually upgraded. And unlike Arch or Gentoo, AL14 can be run by users with little or no prior experience with GNU/Linux.\n\nIt can be booted from a CD and tested without touching your hard drive.\n\nAL14 is optimized to run on as much hardware as possible. It features the LXDE desktop environment and the Faenza icon theme.\n\nIncluded in the iso is among other applications:\n\nTransmission - torrent client\nVLC Media Player - video player\nAbiword -word processor\nGpicview - image viewer\nbleachbit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ system cleaning program\nevince Ã¢â‚¬â€œ PDF viewing client\nChromium Web Browser\nflash-player-plugin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ flash support\nlibdvdcss2 - DVD support\nkernel-2.6.38.8-pclos1.bfs-1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BFS kernel for maximum desktop performance\nleafpad Ã¢â‚¬â€œ text editor\nlxdecc Ã¢â‚¬â€œ LXDE Control Center\nLiveUSB Creator Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Put AL14 on USB key disk\nDeadBeef- Music Players\nnano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Console Text Editor\npcmanfm- File Manager\nPartimage - backup tool\nTor browser bundle - anonymous web browsing with Vidalia, Tor and Firefox \n\n\nAlways remember to do the following prior to installing anything and to keep your system up to date with the latest upgrades:\n\n\n1: Reload\n2: Mark All Upgrades\n3: Apply\n\n\nFile Name : AL14.May.2012.Houston.S.Chamberlain.i586.iso\nSize : 537.3 MB bytes\n\n\nMD5sum:\n60cccc3e62fb8b377084324b02100e3d AL14.May.2012.Houston.S.Chamberlain.i586.iso\n\n\nLogin on the live-cd: guest\nPassword on the live-cd: guest\nRootpassword: root\n\nRoadmap:\n\n\nI'll try to keep AL14 alive and release new isos every few months. Since AL14 is a rolling release, keeping the system properly upgraded will make sure you always have the latest version, hence there is no need to reinstall.\n\n\nIf there is anything you can do to help this project, let me know. I am especially interested in getting in touch with people who know how to make remasters or would like to learn how to.\n\n\nCredits:\n\n\nThanks to the following: mire88 (wallpaper, Grub, GDM background and installation images).\nStrafciger (icons).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece99afaf9bdb0bb0d5d425337bd615ff01cda3d","amp;dn":"AL14.May.2012.Houston.S.Chamberlain.i586.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece99afaf9bdb0bb0d5d425337bd615ff01cda3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,233,154,250,249,189,176,187,13,93,66,83,55,189,97,95,240,28,218,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
