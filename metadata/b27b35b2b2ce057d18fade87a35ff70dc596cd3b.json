Free markets created the middle class, and the AFL's president, in support a law that protected union jobs, lamented that &quot;colored labor is being sought to demoralize wage rates.&quot;\n\nDid you know that FDR's New Deal solved the Great Depression?\n\nActually, it didn't. It's uncertainty, big spending, and regulation that prolonged the Depression. FDR's Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, admitted: &quot;We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work.&quot;\n\nDid you know that Herbert Hoover made the Depression worse because as president...he did nothing? The Washington Post believes that. In 2008, the paper claimed GW Bush was &quot;today's Herbert Hoover&quot; because of his &quot;dogged resistance to assisting anybody.&quot;\n\nActually, Hoover increased spending by 53.5% during his presidency. He signed bad big-government bills like the Davis-Bacon Act and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. He started huge public works projects like the Hoover Dam. Hoover was a big spender -- like Obama.\n\n[...] \n\nSo much of what we think we know...is wrong.\n \n----------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27b35b2b2ce057d18fade87a35ff70dc596cd3b","amp;dn":"20110721-Stossel-%5BPolitically+Incorrect+History%5D-Fox+Business.CF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27b35b2b2ce057d18fade87a35ff70dc596cd3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,123,53,178,178,206,5,125,24,250,222,135,163,95,247,13,197,150,205,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
