It was released in June 22, 2012 via Nuclear Blast.\n\nUnlike Luca Turilli and Luca Turilli's Dreamquest, Luca Turilli's Rhapody is considered as a real part of Rhapsody of Fire, and Ascending to Infinity is referred as &quot;Rhapsody's 11th album&quot;, following all previous Rhapsody of Fire albums. It is the only album to feature Alex Holzwarth on drums, as currently he is only a member of Rhapsody of Fire.\n\n\n\n\nAll lyrics written by Luca Turilli, all music composed by Turilli.\n\n\n1.&quot;Quantum X&quot;  \t                                        2:21\n2.&quot;Ascending to Infinity&quot;  \t                        6:17\n3.&quot;Dante's Inferno&quot;  \t                                4:58\n4.&quot;Excalibur&quot;  \t                                        8:05\n5.&quot;Tormento e Passione&quot;  \t                        4:52\n6.&quot;Dark Fate of Atlantis&quot;  \t                        6:28\n7.&quot;Luna&quot;\t                                        4:16\n8.&quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;  \t                        4:14\n9.&quot;Of Michael the Archangel and Lucifer's Fall&quot; \t16:01\n10.&quot;March of Time&quot; (Helloween cover / Bonus track)\t5:52\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5700f2ff89db0e2a710b721ea4871239e00d4cd","amp;dn":"Ascending+to+Infinity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5700f2ff89db0e2a710b721ea4871239e00d4cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,112,15,47,248,157,176,226,167,16,183,33,234,72,113,35,158,0,212,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
