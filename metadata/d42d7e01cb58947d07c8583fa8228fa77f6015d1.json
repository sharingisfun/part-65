The ten new songs on Locked Down, written by Dr. John with Auerbach and a handpicked crew of backing musicians, combine incantatory chants (&quot;Ellegua&amp;quot and often politically charged raps (&quot;Revolution&amp;quot with candid and soulful reflections (&quot;My Children, My Angels&amp;quot, swaggering R&amp;B (&quot;Big Shot&amp;quot, and a healthy dose of hypnotic, simmering funk (&quot;The King Of Izness&amp;quot. As with much of what this multiple Grammy-award winning singer and composer has recorded over the last five decades, the Big Easy is the musical and spiritual jumping-off point, but these new tracks incorporate a world's worth of influences, from gospel and blues to psychedelic rock and Afro-beat.\n\n\n\ncd ripped with x lossless decoder\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42d7e01cb58947d07c8583fa8228fa77f6015d1","amp;dn":"Dr.+John...Locked+Down+%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42d7e01cb58947d07c8583fa8228fa77f6015d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,45,126,1,203,88,148,125,7,200,88,63,168,34,143,167,127,96,21,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
