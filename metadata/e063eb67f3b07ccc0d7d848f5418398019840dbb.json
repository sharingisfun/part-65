He is told that love caused people to act strangely and was one of the root causes for suffering in the world. He decided to go back to the year 2011 to figure what love is. He winds up making his own discoveries when he meets Elizabeth, who turns out to be the woman of his dreams. Unfortunately, Elizabeth has a boyfriend, Richard. When Pax doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t return to the future by the given deadline, his fellow scientist Bob travels back in time to find him. Upon returning to the future Pax misses Elizabeth and, she is the only thing he is thinking about. He also feels he has lost his chance with her. Bob lets Pax travel all the way back to where Elizabeth and Richard met, which allows Pax to meet Elizabeth first.\n\nGenre: Comedy | Romance | Sci-Fi\nIMDB Rating: 5.4/10 from 429 users\nDirected by: Michael Lange\nStarring: Sara Rue, Barry Watson and Fred Willard\n\nRelease Name: My.Future.Boyfriend.2011.DVDRip.XviD-FRAGMENT\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: XVID, 640 x 352, 1148kbit, 23.97fps\nAudio: English, MP3, 131 kbps\nRuntime: 76min\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e063eb67f3b07ccc0d7d848f5418398019840dbb","amp;dn":"My+Future+Boyfriend+2011+DVDRip+XviD-FRAGMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e063eb67f3b07ccc0d7d848f5418398019840dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,99,235,103,243,176,124,204,13,125,132,143,84,24,57,128,25,132,13,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
