But what does poverty mean today?\n\nThis recent Heritage Foundation study shows that poor people have cars, air conditioning, modern electronics--things even kings didn't have decades ago.\n\nThere is wealth disparity, but that isn't bad; it's just a byproduct of freedom, and life is better when people are free. The rich get richer, and the poor get...richer.\n\nPeople want government to help the poor, but Charlie Sykes, author of A Nation of Moochers, joins us tonight to talk about how government programs make people dependent.\n\nScott Rasmussen polls people on income inequality and shares some surprising results.\n\nCliff Asness share why it's income mobility we should worry about, rather than income equality.\n\nOn thing that hinders that is government schools. Patrick Byrne joins us to explain why school choice will improve prospects for kids.\n\nWe're certainly not helping kids with unsustainable programs like Social Security and Medicare that push debt onto future generations. Charles Goyette and Marc Lamont Hill debate the fairness of entitlements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b0995dd216c15b9509317738ddc4c8592c44b2e","amp;dn":"20120524-Stossel-%5BRich+Man+Poor+Man%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b0995dd216c15b9509317738ddc4c8592c44b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,9,149,221,33,108,21,185,80,147,23,115,141,220,76,133,146,196,75,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
