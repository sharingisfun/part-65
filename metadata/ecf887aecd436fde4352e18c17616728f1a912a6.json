Their\nfirst album of new material in\neight years, its recording\nfollowed the band's 2009\nreunion after a four-year hiatus.\nIt will be the first Blink-182\nalbum produced by the band\nmembers without the help of an\noutside record producer.\nThe album has suffered\nnumerous delays. Although\nseveral demos were recorded in\n2009, work on the album began\nin earnest in June 2010. In April\n2011 the band cancelled a\nEuropean tour, as recording of\nthe album was taking longer\nthan expected. As a result,\nGeffen Records gave the band a\nJuly 31 deadline. The record's\nfirst single, &quot;Up All Night&quot;,\npremiered July 14, 2011; the\nsecond single, &quot;After Midnight&quot;,\npremiered September 6.\nBlink-182 is an American rock\nband from Poway, California that\npredominantly plays pop punk\nmusic. The band was formed in\n1992 as &quot;Blink&quot; with members\nTom DeLonge (vocals, guitar),\nMark Hoppus (vocals, bass) and\nScott Raynor (drums). In 1998,\nmidway through a U.S. tour,\ndrummer Travis Barker replaced\nRaynor. DeLonge left the group\nin early 2005, initiating an\nindefinite hiatus. DeLonge went\non to form Angels &amp; Airwaves,\nwhile Hoppus and Barker\ncontinued playing music together\nin +44. On February 8, 2009,\nBlink-182 announced that they\nare continuing as a band, with\nthe brief statement posted on\ntheir website saying &quot;To put it\nsimply, We're back. We mean,\nreally back. Picking up where we\nleft off and then some. In the\nstudio writing and recording a\nnew album,&quot; which followed\nminutes after the Grammy\nannouncement.\nDeLonge cites punk rock bands\nDescendents and Screeching\nWeasel as influences, although\nthe band's songwriting and\nproduction are driven by a pop\nsensibility. Blink-182 is known for\ntheir simple melodies, teen angst\nand lyrical toilet humor, as well\nas by their hit singles &quot;Dammit&quot;,\n&quot;What's My Age Again?&quot;, &quot;All the\nSmall Things&quot;, &quot;Adam's Song&quot;,\n&quot;The Rock Show&quot;, &quot;First Date&quot;,\n&quot;Stay Together for the Kids&quot;,\n&quot;Feeling This&quot;, and &quot;I Miss You&quot;.\nWhen playing live, the band\ntypically play their songs at a\nfaster tempo and often replace\ncertain lyrics with toilet humor\nand various gags. Over the years,\nthe band has developed a\ndedicated cult following, and\ncontinues to influence a variety\nof musical acts.\nGenre: Rock\nSubgenre: Alternative Rock / Pop Punk\nBitrate: Vbr\nSize: 101.84 MB\nShow/Hide\nFiles: 15 files\nAdded: 14/09/2011\nDownloaded: 4038 time(s)\nPeer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf887aecd436fde4352e18c17616728f1a912a6","amp;dn":"Blink+182+-+Neighborhoods+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%5BMP3-VBR-2011%5D+%5BPR%21M3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf887aecd436fde4352e18c17616728f1a912a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,248,135,174,205,67,111,222,67,82,225,140,23,97,103,40,241,169,18,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
