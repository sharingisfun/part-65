Clicking a jellyfish will wake it up and cause it to jump upward, knocking the ball upward as well. Clicking an orange fish will wake it up and make it dash forward, knocking the ball to the right. Green fish knock the ball to the left, starfish can throw the ball in any direction depending on their color, etc. As the levels get more advanced, puzzles make use of whirlpools, ocean currents, seahorses, turtles and pufferfish!\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/Win7\nCPU: 1.2 GHz\nRAM: 512 MB\nDirectX: 9.0\nHard Drive: 21.5 MB\n\n[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/5949532247_30f46edba1.jpg[/img]\n\nWork like you don't need money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one's watching\n- Unknown Author -\n\nAnd Seed like there is no bandwith limit :)\n\nSupport Us\nYour &quot;Thank You&quot; means a lot\n\n[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5841348205_e896fe6f30.jpg[/img]\n\n\nThanks to Adnan\n\nAnd Let's never forget the work of Flight of the Conchords","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e2959f1fec7323e1e9de1922b54d5b9ae1f5a6","amp;dn":"Slumberfish+-+NEW+Puzzle+Game+%5BAllSmartGames%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e2959f1fec7323e1e9de1922b54d5b9ae1f5a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,226,149,159,31,236,115,35,225,233,222,25,34,181,77,91,154,225,245,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
