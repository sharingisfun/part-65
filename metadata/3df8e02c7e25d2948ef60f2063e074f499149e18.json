In Generals, the United States and China are the world's two superpowers, and are the targets of the Global Liberation Army, a large, well-organized terrorist organization, fighting as a fanatical irregular force. The United States and China are depicted as allies in the series, and frequently co-operate with each other throughout the storyline against the Global Liberation Army, which is depicted as an omnipresent, borderless organization with unclear goals beyond opposition to and expulsion of both China and the United States. The three factions are thus engaged in a war similar to that of the real-life War on Terror.\n\nThe player can play any of the three sides in any order, with each side's campaign consisting of seven missions. The storyline follows the order of China first, then the GLA, then the USA. In this order, China retaliates for a devastating GLA nuclear attack on Beijing, destroys the Three Gorges Dam, uses China's nuclear arsenal and eventually completely crushing the GLA cell masterminding all Pacific rim operations. The GLA campaign then begins, with the organization trying to recover from its recent setback at the hands of the Chinese, by raising funds and instigating attacks against their American and Chinese antagonists, eventually culminating in the overtaking of the Baikonur Cosmodrome for the firing of a Soyuz rocket bearing a biological MIRV at a nondescript city. At this point the American campaign begins, in which the USA engages the GLA across several locales, including Baghdad and the Caspian Sea, before defeating a rogue Chinese general supporting the terrorists and tracking them back to their base of operations in Akmola, Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Generals story is continued in the expansion pack Command &amp; Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour which leads to the US retaking Baikonur, the GLA attack to US West Coast causing retreat of US forces from Europe, then GLA invasion to Europe, and China defeating the GLA and seizing the opportunity of rising as a superpower.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df8e02c7e25d2948ef60f2063e074f499149e18","amp;dn":"Command+and+Conquer+Generals+Zero+Hour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df8e02c7e25d2948ef60f2063e074f499149e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,248,224,44,126,37,210,148,142,246,15,32,99,224,116,244,153,20,158,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
