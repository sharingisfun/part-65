I am sure over the next couple of\ndays, many users will be sure to take full advantage of this option. That is, before Sony\ncatches on and decides to put a stop to it; which may have to wait until after this year's E3\nconvention, scheduled for June 5th - 7th.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69630dc01b03d3564208641a98152ababf4b434e","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+4.11V+Spoofer+2.2+3.55+ONLY+%26amp%3B+Rebug+Update+Package+0.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69630dc01b03d3564208641a98152ababf4b434e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,99,13,192,27,3,211,86,66,8,100,26,152,21,42,186,191,75,67,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
