And indeed, it's an apt description, as those who are actively involved in the beer community think of it a near-religious experience to make and enjoy well-made brew.\n\nBut Beervana also describes the transcendent union of climate and environment which makes Oregon the home to great hops growing and affords the brewmasters the highest quality water.\n\nThese forces made it possible for early immigrant braumeisters to come to this place and succeed making a product that legions of thirsty workers would enjoy as they shaped the place we now call home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2160a094b6cfb1d1092a2cda9c79f6eb7c801de","amp;dn":"Beervana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2160a094b6cfb1d1092a2cda9c79f6eb7c801de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,22,10,9,75,108,251,29,16,146,162,205,169,199,159,110,183,200,1,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
