Author and international script consultant Dr. Rachel Ballon explores the writing craft and emphasizes creativity in the writing process. She blends her expertise in script analysis and writing coaching with her personal experience as a screenwriter to help writers construct their stories and characters.\n\nStarting with the story's framework, Dr. Ballon helps readers to understand the key &quot;building blocks&quot; of story structure and character development, including characters' emotional and psychological states, story conflicts, and scene and act structure. She also covers the essential components in the script writing process, such as outlines, script treatments, synopses, and formats. Dr. Ballon devotes a chapter to overcoming writer's block--the writer's greatest obstacle--and offers guidance for taking the next steps once a script is completed.\n\nA practical tool for any writer, this distinctive resource:\n*offers a blueprint for writers to follow, breaking the writing process down into specific, easy-to-follow steps;\n*stresses the psychology of the characters as well as that of the writer; and\n*offers first-hand knowledge of the screenwriting process and gives practical advice for completing and marketing scripts.\n\nWith its unique and insightful approach to the writing process, this book will be indispensable for scriptwriters, fiction writers, and professional writers, and it will serve as a useful text in screenwriting courses.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 184 pages\n    * Publisher: Routledge; 2 edition (September 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0805849238\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0805849233","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e325ae0fec155570b7c1596f328d0929aafe2a6a","amp;dn":"Blueprint+For+Screenwriting+%2C2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e325ae0fec155570b7c1596f328d0929aafe2a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,37,174,15,236,21,85,112,183,193,89,111,50,141,9,41,170,254,42,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
