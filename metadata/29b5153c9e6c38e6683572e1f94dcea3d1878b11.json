SBK X includes a career mode, allowing the player to personalize their rider and manage their career. For even further game play options, players can choose to race in arcade and simulation modes for a quick blast around the track or a detailed simulation. Whichever game play style is preferred, with up to 16 player online multiplayer, SBK X is the most complete sport bike experience on the market.\n\n[b]Features:[/b]\n\n- Fully Licensed: from three different classes [Superstock, WSS, and SBK], face over 90 actual racers on their bikes and in their circuits.\n- Multiplayer: go wheel to wheel with up to 15 of your gearhead friends.\n- Evolving Tracks: The track isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just the path you follow, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a living part of the race experience!
