It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:777e6fbd012f59421209dadbb00181ba9a0ca4fd","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+13+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"777e6fbd012f59421209dadbb00181ba9a0ca4fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,126,111,189,1,47,89,66,18,9,218,219,176,1,129,186,154,12,164,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
