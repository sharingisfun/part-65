The United States faces the real risk that adversaries will exploit vulnerabilities in the nation s critical information systems, thereby causing considerable suffering and damage. \nOnline e-commerce business, government agency files, and identity records are all potential security targets. \nToward a Safer and More Secure Cyberspace examines these Internet security vulnerabilities and offers a strategy for future research aimed at countering cyber attacks. \nIt also explores the nature of online threats and some of the reasons why past research for improving cybersecurity has had less impact than anticipated, \nand considers the human resource base needed to advance the cybersecurity research agenda. \nThis book will be an invaluable resource for Internet security professionals, information technologists, policy makers, data stewards, e-commerce providers, \nconsumer protection advocates, and others interested in digital security and safety.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d215db6c835fa475368d94449c20acf600d74590","amp;dn":"Toward+a+Safer+and+More+Secure+Cyberspace%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d215db6c835fa475368d94449c20acf600d74590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,21,219,108,131,95,164,117,54,141,148,68,156,32,172,246,0,215,69,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
