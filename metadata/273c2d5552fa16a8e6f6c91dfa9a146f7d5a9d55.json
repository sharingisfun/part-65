On Windows 7, the easiest way to convert this file is to use Windows Disc Image Burner. On Windows XP and Windows Vista, a third-party program is required to convert an .iso file into installable mediaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and DVD burning software often includes this capability.\n \nNote: The .iso file that contains the developer tools requires a large capacity DVD called a DVD-9, as well as a DVD burner that can handle dual-layer (DL) DVDs. Most modern burners should be able to handle this format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:273c2d5552fa16a8e6f6c91dfa9a146f7d5a9d55","amp;dn":"Windows+8+Developer+Preview+64+bit+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"273c2d5552fa16a8e6f6c91dfa9a146f7d5a9d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,60,45,85,82,250,22,168,230,246,201,29,250,154,20,111,125,90,157,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
