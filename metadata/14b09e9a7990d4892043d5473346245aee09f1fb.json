The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b09e9a7990d4892043d5473346245aee09f1fb","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+Blue+-+8.200+-+Russian+-+CDROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b09e9a7990d4892043d5473346245aee09f1fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,176,158,154,121,144,212,137,32,67,213,71,51,70,36,90,238,9,241,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
