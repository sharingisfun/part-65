Centuries later, the magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power grows ever stronger. The land cries out for a new hero, a powerful warrior or a mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of yore.\n\nWhat they have, unfortunately, is you...\n\nStep into the Dungeons of Dredmor! Embrace your destiny! Face evil of the likes the world has never known - the terrifying Swarmies, the undulating Thrusties, and the adoreable nest-building Diggles. Worship Inconsequentia, the Goddess of Pointless Sidequests, or try your luck as a devotee of the nameless Lutefisk God. Cast powerful magic learned from the dark business warlocks of the school of Necronomiconomics, or summon the Viking Runes of your ancestors to blast your foes with thunder and lightning! Discover the power that can be had by wielding a bizarre armament of devastating weaponry such as the Interdimensional Axe, the Plastic Ring, and the Invisible Shield (if you can remember where you left it). Wield shoes decorated by the Dwarven Glittersmiths, all of whom have now committed suicide because of their shame, and embrace the joys of destroying giant moustache-wielding brick demons with a mace decorated with tawdry, delicious bacon.\n\nWhile youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at it, be prepared to die. A lot. In hideous, screaming pain that makes you throw your keyboard out the window.\n\nThe Dungeons of Dredmor await. Are you ready for them?\n\n-----\n\nNo crack needed, just unzip and play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a129bf6039f4d1757948e4b8c7a3eca7d959de4","amp;dn":"Dungeons+of+Dredmor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a129bf6039f4d1757948e4b8c7a3eca7d959de4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,18,155,246,3,159,77,23,87,148,142,75,140,122,62,202,125,149,157,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
