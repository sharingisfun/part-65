What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 7 - Tuesday - The Mystery Box winner is eager to win an immunity pin. To win they must beat former Billy Kwong Chef, Hamish Ingham from Bar H. With a choice of tea or coffee as the core ingredient. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d287978ee7b9d54db5984fe7b586a4071ef416","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E39.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d287978ee7b9d54db5984fe7b586a4071ef416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,210,135,151,142,231,185,213,77,181,152,79,231,181,134,164,7,30,244,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
