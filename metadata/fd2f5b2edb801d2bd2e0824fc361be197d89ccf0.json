Students on summer break are exposed to a deadly virus that is spread rapidly through direct human contact. The infected become enslaved by the invading &quot;swarm&quot; intelligence and driven by an insatiable appetite to consume human flesh. Returning home, the students spread the infection to their fellow classmates and other unsuspecting townspeople. One by one, more students fall victim to the plague,triggering an epidemic that spawns a horde of ravenous zombies. The zombie horde grows and spreads quickly. Amidst the chaos, a campus security guard,obsessed with conspiracy theories, leads a group of students to safety as they and a small band of uninfected townspeople set out to find other human survivors in an attempt to discover the source of the &quot;zombie&quot; virus and save the world.\n\n\n[/code][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2f5b2edb801d2bd2e0824fc361be197d89ccf0","amp;dn":"Human+vs+Zombies+2011+iNTERNAL+DVDRip+XviD-8BaLLRiPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2f5b2edb801d2bd2e0824fc361be197d89ccf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,47,91,46,219,128,29,43,210,224,130,79,195,97,190,25,125,137,204,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
