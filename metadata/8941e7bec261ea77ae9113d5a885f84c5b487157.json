If you wish to have a picture, flash animation, movie, or work of fiction removed, please fuck off kindly.\n\n---\nIntroduction\n\nThe main reason I made this was to combat porn threads by giving those who want to fap, a whole collection of porn that would normally be on /vp/. I don't care how you use it, hell, post it on /vp/. But it's probably a better idea to just fap to yourself anyways. Please share the /rs/ link in porn threads.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;/rs/Gary+Oak\n\n                                   SHARING IS CARING!\n\n---\nFAQ\n\nQ: Why is there no M+M gay?\nA: It's in a different part of the Archive. Check here http://rs.4chan.org/s=Gary+Oak\n\nQ: Something is in the wrong place!\nA: Don't panic, drop an email and I'll get it fixed right away. Simply send the name of the file in the email, and I'll take care of it.\n\nQ: Why is there so much shit in this?\nA: I've made an attempt to get rid of all the REALLY bad art. If you were in my position, you would know that this is the creme de la crop. It's fucking Pokeporn and 99% of it is shit. I've had to go through thousands of pictures just for this. When you have seen that many, you'll know the truth.\n\nQ: Why is there a lot of X pokemon/character compared to Y pokemon/character?\nA: Some pokemon/characters just don't have that much porn. Sorry bro.\n\nQ: Why is there Digimon in the Archive?\nA: It's a joke.\n\nQ: Can I have some of your real contact info?\nA: No. I check my emails often. Use that.\n\nQ: What's your waifu?\nA: Blaziken. Hnngh.\n\nQ: Gary? Posting porn?\nA: Yes, it's called irony.\n\nQ: What can I do to help?\nA: A thank you and a .7z of all of your pokeporn onwould be nice.\n\n---\nUseful Tools\n\n7-Zip: Better than WinRAR/zip and FREE!\nLink: http://www.7-zip.org/\n\nuTorrent: Piracy ahoy! Also, a neat tool for fast legit downloads too! I recommend the v2.X, though v3.0 works fine too.\nLink: http://www.utorrent.com/\n\n4chanX: A userscript that has more support than 4chan Plus (Which is dead in the water right now) It requires greasemonkey on Firefox/Nightly, and Chrome/ium users can install it right away.\nLink: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/51412\n\nGarynator: The program I used to sort most of the archive. It's many times faster than sorting manually and saved hours of labor. Full keyboard support, and a navigation mode for easy viewing. Still in a beta, but it's still quite workable. Courtesy of wat. For the Archive, it is in navigation mode by default. DDL users can find it as a DDL .7z on the /rs/ page.\n\nYou can find the program and Readme in the Garynator folder, or for torrent users, in the root folder for the archive.\n&gt;Java\n&gt;2011\n---\n\nChangelog\n\n- v1.95 and below\nCan be viewed in older versions.\n\n- v2.0\nFully implemented naming system, more porn. Public beta of the Garynator sorting program.\nTotal size: 2.89GB\n\n- v2.1\nPossible: Individual .7z archives for each folder and a slightly more substantial gay archive\n(Assuming people send me new material)\nTotal size:\n\n---\nCredits and Thanks\n\n\n- Every artist that has created everything in here. Without you guys, there'd be nothing in the first place!\n- wat, for making the Garynator program, sorting so much porn, and being a cool guy.\n- Keith, qnqnx, Kris, Trainer With a Mouth, Sofa, Dark, cptkirkcobain, Reginald, wat, Raging Furfag, and Anonymous for content.\n- Lyraeon and FicFags Anonymous for being cool guys and writing erotic fiction for the rest of us!\n- Raging Furfag, Hoppip, Pornodex Guy, Zalgo, Unown, and Alex for being pretty cool guys.\n- Anonymous, for helping contribute and supporting the project.\n- I don't say thanks to any haters.
