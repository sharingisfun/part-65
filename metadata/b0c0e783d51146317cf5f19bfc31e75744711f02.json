Short  Stavin Chain Blues\nRecorded: February 8, 1958 in St. Louis, Missouri\nReleased: 1961 (LP) 2005(CD)\nLabel: Delmark Records\nFormat:Flac\n\n\nJoe dug into a patch And scuffed cardboard guitar case rummaged through a spare shirt And old recording contracts And came out with a handbill with his photo on it to prove that he was the Joe Williams of Columbia Records fame. Once Joe sat down And played his bastard instrument the proprietor knew he was listening to the raw country blues of one of his favorite singers. Joe insisted on a formal audition at his cousin's home on Cole Street the following Sunday afternoon. by the light of a bare 40-watt bulb Koester heard for the first time the magnificent combination of two guitars And blues harmonica without surface noise. The other guitar was played by Joe's cousin J. D. Short\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Stavin' Chain Blues 4:10\n2. Roll &amp; Tumble 2:54\n3. Mean Stepfather 3:25\n4. You Got To Help Me Some 3:24\n5.
