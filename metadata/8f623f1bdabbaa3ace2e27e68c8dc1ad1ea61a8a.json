The subtitle tracks are resolution independent and they are rendered in real-time as you watch the movie. They are always displayed at the best quality possible for your device or application, from your 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HDTV down to your iPhone.\n\nThere are support for multiple languages in the same movie, and you can even switch languages on the fly as you watch.\n\nIf you already have a movie in a format that suits your needs there's no reason to re-encode it, just add the subtitles and you're good to go. If, on the other hand, your movie is not suited for your device you can batch re-encode it straight from within the application. \n\nYou can also tag your file with metadata so it's easier to find in your growing library of tv-shows and videos.\n\nMain Features\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Add soft, non-destructive subtitles, that won't change or alter the original movie.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Subtitles can be turned on/off using the interface of the device or application.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Complete support for multiple languages in the same file.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supported devices are iPad, iPod (Touch, Classic, Nano), iPhone (2G, 3G, 3GS), Apple TV.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Built-in subtitle online search with automatic download, unarchive and parsing.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supported applications are iTunes, QuickTime Player or any application that can play a QuickTime Movie.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports all major subtitle file formats like SubRip (.srt), SubViewer 1 &amp; 2 (.sub), SubStation Alpha (.ssa/.ass) and MicroDVD.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Matroska subtitles, like ssa/ass and srt, are automatically converted to soft subtitle tracks on import.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sync subtitles in real-time using the time offset stepper.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Metadata.
