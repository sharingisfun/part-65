The only advert for the software appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and only appears every so many minutes.  Most of the time I don't even notice it when I watch my conversion.\n\nThis episode is about creating an ancient computer that displays the locations of the planets.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b034d50ecdcaf742f54404dfd0f7f79329f4a80","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Ancient.Computer.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b034d50ecdcaf742f54404dfd0f7f79329f4a80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,3,77,80,236,220,175,116,47,84,64,77,253,15,127,121,50,159,74,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
