Served in three wars; WWII, Korea and Vietnam. He has enjoyed a long and successful profession as an executive in the petroleum industry. His life long outside interests include electronics and engineering. A popular walk on substitute for University Professors in physics, chemistry, biology and computer assisted drafting. Teaching style similar to Richard Feynman. He has celebrity status in Japan and Saudi Arabia. His website http://altenergy-pro.com is worldwide and is on more than 2000 separate servers. He also serves on several multibillion dollar corporation amongst their esteemed Board of Directors.\n\nDon has designed and built fully functional energy related devices with very little outside assistance. It is quite the honor to have him as a presenter for our Inventor's Weekend. \n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nDon states that useful electricity is obtained from disturbed electrons, which radiate magnetic fields and waves. He says that a generator disturbs and collects this emitted electron energy. These electrons remain fully in tact and undiminished until the end of time. This Energy is free and the cost of accessing it depends on the ignorance of the collector. This none ionic electron cloud permeates the cosmos and with an appropriate collector system provides an unending source of environmentally benign, inexpensive, available energy everywhere. The EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ambient background is an enormous unending source of electrical energy. More details are made available on Don's website. Devices and methods not related to the Rube Goldberg energy systems are currently in use by special interest will be examined and tested.
