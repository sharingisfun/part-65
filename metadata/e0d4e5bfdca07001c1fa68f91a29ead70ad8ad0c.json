The current version i simply do not trust.\n\n( Take a look at the file size difference for obvious signs of crapware inside the new version )\n\nI also recommend using this in conjunction with Iron from SRWare, the iron source is also available. I believe as late as version 15. I'm not certain about the latest version.\n\n\nMost notably in my humble opinion:\nThis combined with Iron gives you a &quot;i can see you but you cant see me&quot; type of surfing &quot;feel&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo spam is intended with this upload. Only educational benefits. By no means do i want anyone to feel obligated to download this or the chromium port mentioned above.\nUse at own risk.\n\nThis chrome extension like most is cross platform and will work on macOS and linux.\n\nTo install simply extract and drag the crx file into the browser window.\n\n\nI will try and add more useful extensions in the future. I do have a extensions list that is massive for chromium but i think best not to post here.\nGood luck and smooth safe browsing!
