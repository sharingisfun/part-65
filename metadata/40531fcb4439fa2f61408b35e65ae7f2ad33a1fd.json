They decided on an all-stakes gamble Ã¢â‚¬â€œ travel to Porcupine Creek, Alaska and prospect for gold. Most of the people on the show have little or no previous gold mining experience and must learn on the job.\n\n\nSeason 2\nFor season 2, Todd missed a lease payment, and &quot;Dakota&quot; Fred Hurt buys the claim out from owner Earl Foster, not needing to break the lease due to the missed payment.
