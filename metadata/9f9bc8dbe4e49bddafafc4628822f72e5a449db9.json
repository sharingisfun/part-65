Now performing (and living) as Justin Vivian BondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with a middle name added to reflect a transsexual identityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½s/he has released a pretty terrific solo album.\n\nA dendrophile is a lover of trees, and BondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a fixture of New York and San Francisco over the past few decadesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½says many of these songs were composed during retreats to a haven in our own Tennessee mountains. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even some Appalachian musical influence, in the banjo-driven ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEquipoiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and in the way the seductive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSalomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lifts part of its melody from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWayfaring Stranger.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But BondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s diverse tastes also range to stormy jazz, piano pop, slinky soul, and a fine Joni Mitchell cover. A medley of the CarpentersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSuperstarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Joan BaezÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDiamonds and RustÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ shows an undimmed genius for interpretation and interpolation, turning them into an eight-minute meditation on fame, desire, and regret. Also intact is the arch ribaldry that animated Kiki, in lines like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeavenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the palm of your hand/Reach in your pocket and stroke it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Even on the ostensibly elegiac ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the End,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Bond canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t resist the entendre in the title, quavering, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe all get it in the endÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as if we should all be so lucky. Overall, Dendrophile makes a strong case for BondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s singular talents. It is warm, angry, funny, and fierce.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/05/12/justin-vivian-bond/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/05/12/justin-vivian-bond/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9bc8dbe4e49bddafafc4628822f72e5a449db9","amp;dn":"Justin+Vivian+Bond...Dendrophile%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9bc8dbe4e49bddafafc4628822f72e5a449db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,155,200,219,228,228,155,221,175,175,196,98,136,34,247,46,90,68,157,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
