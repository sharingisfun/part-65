The inevitable consequence of disagreement\nwithin the Church was that it split into countless denominations. The\nbest way to point out the fallibility of the Bible is to use the Bible against\nthe Bible.\n\nAbout the Author\nGrowing up in Europe Alex Varga was exposed to many different\nreligious beliefs by his parents and relatives. He came to the United\nStates as a political refugee following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\nwhere as a soldier he fought against communist forces. After settling\ndown in California he discovered liberal as well as alarmingly\nfundamental Christian religious beliefs that reminded him of\ncommunist indoctrination that led to the inevitable loss of personal\nfreedom. He is a retired educator and lives with his family in the Napa\nValley.\n\nIn the torrent you can find the English and the Hungarian version of the book.\nThis is a reupload because the previous had tracker problems and I also added a Hungarian version of the book.\n\nTorrent uploaded with the permission of author, if you like it, you can buy the paperback at amazon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a3d7274d91c2fb9172e84e39830de5ee8c3fddc","amp;dn":"God+versus+God+%2F+Isten+Isten+ellen+by+Alex+Varga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a3d7274d91c2fb9172e84e39830de5ee8c3fddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,61,114,116,217,28,47,185,23,46,132,227,152,48,222,94,232,195,253,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
