Google will probably find more. I do not give technical info, because I am old and I do not understand most of it !!\n  \n\nI upload interesting programs, mostly from BBC1,BBC2 and BBC4 that nobody else uploads but I am disabled and it is difficult for me to use a keyboard, so I do not bother with information that able bodied pirates can easily find on the net !!\n\n\nI may quit after this upload, and concentrate on my day job, caring for sad EE addicts. They are more tolerant, and let me amuse myself by playing my childish, narcissistic games !!\n \n\nYour comments are still appreciated, so please leave them, good, bad, humourous or sympathetic !!\n\nWinx HQ 1200/160k\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8ae48778316f09d7799c1b9e58891cf8e11e09d","amp;dn":"BBC1+Countryfile++29-04-12.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8ae48778316f09d7799c1b9e58891cf8e11e09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,174,72,119,131,22,240,157,119,153,193,185,229,136,145,207,142,17,224,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
