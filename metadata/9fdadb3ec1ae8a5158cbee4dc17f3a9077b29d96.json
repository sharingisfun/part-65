From pathfinding pilots to scientists, from the officers confronted with Hitler's atrocities at Belsen to the inventors of radar ; they all played a part in hastening the end of the most cataclysmic conflict ever.\n\nWeapons of WW II \nIn 1939, the world went to war using obsolete weaponry. In order to gain supremacy it was necessary for an army of designers, inventors and manufacturers to develop and manufacture more and more sophisticated killing machines. In this series &quot;WEAPONS OF WORLD WAR II&quot; the development of each weapon system is addressed from the outbreak of war through to its peak in 1945.\n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for BBC Worldwide Ltd\n\n\n\nEpisode 5 : The Men who Sank the Bismarck\n\nCompleted in 1940, the Bismarck was widely regarded as the most powerful warship in the world. In April 1941, Admiral Tovey of the British Royal Navy detected an attempt by the Bismarck to break out into the Atlantic and the hunt was on. In a first battle, the Bismarck sank HMS Hood. But Tovey used radar to track her down again and finally she was surrounded by British heavy warships and pounded into submission.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 3047 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 23:39.200\nNumber Of Parts: 20\nPart Size: 550 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fdadb3ec1ae8a5158cbee4dc17f3a9077b29d96","amp;dn":"BBC.Heroes.and.Weapons.of.WWII.05of20.The.Men.Who.Sank.the.Bisma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fdadb3ec1ae8a5158cbee4dc17f3a9077b29d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,218,219,62,193,174,138,81,88,203,238,77,193,127,58,144,119,178,157,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
