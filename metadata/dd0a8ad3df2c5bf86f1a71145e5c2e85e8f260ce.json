Hennessy\nDavid A. Patterson\n4th Edition\n\nThrough four editions of this book, our goal has been to describe the basic principles underlying what will be tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technological developments.\n...\nAs with earlier versions, we have strived to produce a new edition that will\ncontinue to be as relevant for professional engineers and architects as it is for\nthose involved in advanced computer architecture and design courses. As much\nas its predecessors, this edition aims to demystify computer architecture through\nan emphasis on cost-performance-power trade-offs and good engineering design.\n\nPublished by Morgan Kaufman, an imprint of El$evier.\n\nRIP library dot nu, RIP ifile dot it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd0a8ad3df2c5bf86f1a71145e5c2e85e8f260ce","amp;dn":"Computer+Architecture+-+a+quantitative+approach+-+Hennessy+%26amp%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd0a8ad3df2c5bf86f1a71145e5c2e85e8f260ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,10,138,211,223,44,91,248,111,26,113,20,94,92,46,133,232,242,96,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
