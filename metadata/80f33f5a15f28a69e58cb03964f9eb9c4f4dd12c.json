Or does he? Upon the sale of his lucrative business, his retirement, and more money and time than he knows what to do with, there are many sudden changes in his life. Starting with his overbearing (but well-meaning) sister Elise (Wendie Malick, Just Shoot Me, Hot In Cleveland, and All My Children) who decides giving Paul a dog would be the perfect start. With little else to do, Paul assumes the daily dog walking routine in the park. There he encounters Andy Chance (Chris Murrah), a gay self-employed advertising whiz, who happens to walk his dog on the very same scheduleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nnull\n\nGenre: Comedy\nIMDB rating: 5.3/10 from 40 users\nDirected by: Jay Arnold\nStarring: Jon Lindstrom, Wendie Malick and Chris Murrah\n\nRelease Name: What.Happens.Next.2011.DVDRip.XviD-FRAGMENT\nSize: 700MB\nQuality: Xvid, 640 x 352 , @852kbit\nAudio : English 113kbits/s VBR mp3\nRuntime: 100min\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f33f5a15f28a69e58cb03964f9eb9c4f4dd12c","amp;dn":"What.Happens.Next.2011.DVDRip.XviD-FRAGMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f33f5a15f28a69e58cb03964f9eb9c4f4dd12c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,243,63,90,21,242,138,105,229,140,176,57,100,249,235,156,79,77,209,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
