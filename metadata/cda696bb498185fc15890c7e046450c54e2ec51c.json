There was        \n         also plenty of family friendly fare, like the classic        \n         Short Circuit, or this frequently overlooked title. Some     \n         may be surprised that it was in fact produced by Cannon      \n         Films, the production company of Israeli cousins Menahem     \n         Golan and Yoram Globus, which is best remembered for its     \n         long line of over-hyped low budget flicks of the 80s,        \n         including Masters of the Universe and various Chuck          \n         Norris vehicles. Their output was perhaps more varied        \n         than the many action films they're remembered for, and       \n         this serves as an example of that.                           \n                                                                      \n           Another big 80s phenomenon was the troubled child          \n         star. Bridgette Andersen had a promising career after        \n         having appeared on shows like Family Ties, Remington         \n         Steele and The Golden Girls, and a starring role in          \n         Savannah Smiles. Too Much was to be her final starring       \n         role however, and she would hardly act again, dying ten      \n         years later from an overdose of drugs and alcohol.           \n                                                                      \n           Together with a catchy and wonderfully kitsch              \n         soundtrack, and awful wooden acting, this film has all       \n         the ingredients of a forgotten 80s classic.                  \n                                                                      \n           Thanks to a friend for providing this PDTV source,         \n         which even with hardsubs looks and sounds much better        \n         than VHS, the only format this was ever released as.         \n                                                                      \n                      Enjoy!                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                 \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda696bb498185fc15890c7e046450c54e2ec51c","amp;dn":"Too.Much.1987.SUBBED.PDTV.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda696bb498185fc15890c7e046450c54e2ec51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,166,150,187,73,129,133,252,21,137,12,126,4,100,80,197,78,46,197,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
