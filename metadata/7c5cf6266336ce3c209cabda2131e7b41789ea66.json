Determined men and women \n\nsuffer through physical and emotional pain as they head out to \n\nremote locations to mine for gold. They will either strike it \n\nrich or go broke trying.\n\nAmong those Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgoing for the goldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are: John Reeves, one of the \n\nlargest private landowners in the state. With gold prices \n\nsoaring, John is taking a second look at the properties he \n\nowns. Helping him in hunt for treasure is an archive of old \n\nmaps that will hopefully point him to where the gold is on his \n\nvast property. He brings in his city slicker kids to help him \n\nprospect and hopefully find the mother lode.\n\nThen thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Doug Baker. Part brilliant mining engineer, part \n\nmad scientist, Doug leads his family mining operation: the \n\ndown-and-dirty Mudminers. Doug is half a million dollars in the \n\nhole after a disastrous season last year. If this season isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t \n\nhis best, it will be his last.\n\nFinally, we have CCR Mining, a company started by two young \n\nupstarts, Creighton Lapp and Chuck Tillian, who are looking to \n\njoin the big leagues. They have leased a mining claim that is \n\nsupposedly Ã¢â‚¬Å“gold richÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Clark Durant. CCR has high hopes \n\nfor the season, but get off to a slow start amid a series of \n\nmiscommunications.
