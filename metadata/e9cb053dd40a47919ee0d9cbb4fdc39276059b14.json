Ken &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson (Wilson) and Dave Starsky (Stiller) are a tough pair of plain-clothes cops who drive a red and white Ford Torino and solve cases with the assistance of their informant, Huggy Bear (Snoop Dogg). While investigating their latest case, the duo realize that the culprit is none other than Reese Feldman (Vince Vaughn), the criminal involved in their first bust. Starsky &amp; Hutch also features appearance by Juliette Lewis, Will Ferrell, and Matt Walsh, who, along with Snoop Dogg and Vaughn, all had roles in director Todd Phillips' last film, Old School.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 40 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 404\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9cb053dd40a47919ee0d9cbb4fdc39276059b14","amp;dn":"Starsky+and+Hutch%282004%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9cb053dd40a47919ee0d9cbb4fdc39276059b14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,203,5,61,212,10,71,145,158,224,217,203,180,253,195,146,118,5,155,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
