When you see the numbers 11, 111, or 1111 on your digital clock you are given that moment to focus your energy and drop into a space of manifestation. It acts like a doorway, a gateway or a portal into the higher realms of manifestation. It is good to just stop what you are doing and take that minute to hold higher thoughts on what it is you want to bring forth in your life. Eleven is a number of masters.\n\nOur Music can be used for relaxation, meditation/prayer, creativity, yoga/movement/dance, breathwork/rebirthing, shamanic journeys, psychophysical integration, DNA activation, massage/reiki/vibrational healing, chakra balancing, kundalini awakening, astral travel/OBEs, time travel, lucid dreaming, brain/mind machines, sound table explorations, rejuvenation of the body temple, physical immortality and multidimensional ascension. These transmissions are in harmonic resonance with all 2012 alignment codes. All meditation type practices can be enhanced by using music for sound healing &amp; transformational processes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66b2ca201804c3a91ed8e884431e1397dbffaeb1","amp;dn":"Shapeshifter+%2F+Visionary+Music+-+11%3A11+Transmission+of+Light+Cod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66b2ca201804c3a91ed8e884431e1397dbffaeb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,178,202,32,24,4,195,169,30,216,232,132,67,30,19,151,219,255,174,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
