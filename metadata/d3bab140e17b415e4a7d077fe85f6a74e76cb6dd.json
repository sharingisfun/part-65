YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find whatever you need on this album: comedy and satire; history and philosophy; battle talk and competition; love and consciousness; and cutting-edge flows and tricky wordplay. Despite his fierce battle reputation Ape finds time to enlighten those older and younger on the evolution of Hip Hop and what it really is as opposed to rap music. Any given stage performance from Ape might include break dancing or hat tricks, or both. Destined to bring justice and glory to every hardcore disciple of the culture, Ape plans to defy all stereotypes and gimmicks and make real Hip Hop important again; a true leader.  \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3bab140e17b415e4a7d077fe85f6a74e76cb6dd","amp;dn":"Monkey+Biz...Animal+Odyssey%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3bab140e17b415e4a7d077fe85f6a74e76cb6dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,186,177,64,225,123,65,94,74,125,7,127,232,95,106,116,231,108,182,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
