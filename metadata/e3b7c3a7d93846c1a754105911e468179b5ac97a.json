Unlike other animated series based on Bible stories, these programs are not based on modern characters interacting with Biblical figures, but rather provide dramatic retelling of the Bible stories themselves. The series was created to be a non-denominational informative and educational tool to help parents, caregivers, and educators instill positive spiritual values and character traits to those in their care.\n\n\nThe series was directed by Richard Rich, the ex-Disney director who also directed The Swan Princess trilogy, and other animated educational programs such as the Animated Hero Classics and the K10C: KidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ten Commandments.\n\n01 Bread Heaven\n02 Built Rock\n03 Forgive Debts\n04 He Is Risen\n05 Jesus the Son of God\n06 John the Baptist\n07 Lazarus Lives\n08 Lord I Believe\n09 The Prodigal Son\n10 Saul of Tarsus\n11 Good Samaritan\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b7c3a7d93846c1a754105911e468179b5ac97a","amp;dn":"Animated+Stories+from+the+New+Testament+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b7c3a7d93846c1a754105911e468179b5ac97a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,183,195,167,217,56,70,193,167,84,16,89,17,228,104,23,155,90,201,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
