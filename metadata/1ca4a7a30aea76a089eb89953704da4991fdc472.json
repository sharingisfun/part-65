This is actually my secondary account.\n\nSo here's the re-uploaded torrent again, I hope this one brings you some more down-speed than the previous one did cuz wow, that was some lame speed.\nAnyway, here's a short guide on how to get things started:\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n::: GUIDE :::\n\n1. Download the torrent! Inside is a .rar file which you will need a tool to unpack the content inside, let say WinRAR for example or 7Zip.\n\n2. Make sure your game is installed already, locate the game-directory and copy the &quot;KoreanElinV01.exe&quot; straight into the game folder.\n\n3. Run the &quot;KoreanElinV01.exe&quot; as an administrator (Win Vista/7/8 users), otherwise just run it.\n\n4. Make sure to check that &quot;Backup&quot; button below the almighty patch button before you patch the game in case EnMasse would like to dick around and change some codes.\n\n5. Go back here to this page, rate it, and give it a comment if it saved your day!\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm not the creator of this patch or whatever you want to call it, the file was downloaded directly fromwhich has been removed for unknown reasons.\nI ensure you this is not a virus, I've been using this patch myself and i have plenty of copies spread out allover my pc, my usb-stick, my phone... just in case.\n\n\nNow I feel like I've written too much.\nAll I'm asking for, please keep this torrent alive by seeding it. my broadband (as mentioned before) sux, atleast my upload-speed to please help me out with this.\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca4a7a30aea76a089eb89953704da4991fdc472","amp;dn":"TERA+Online+-+Korean+Elin+fix+for+NA+and+EU+clients","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca4a7a30aea76a089eb89953704da4991fdc472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,164,167,163,10,234,118,160,137,235,137,149,55,4,218,73,145,253,196,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
