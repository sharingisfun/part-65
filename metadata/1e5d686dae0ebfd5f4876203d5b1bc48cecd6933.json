But when the kids get to Madison County, the author is no where to be found and the towns people act like they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen him in years. They also say that the killer never existed and the murders never happened. However, when the kids start digging around to get their own answers, they find out that the stories maybe more real than the townspeople are letting on!\n\nGenre: Horror | Mystery | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10\nDirected by: Eric England\nStarring: Ace Marrero, Nick Principe and Dayton Knoll\n\nRelease Name: Madison.County.2011.DVDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-SiC\nSize: 1.4GB\nVideo: X264, 720Ãƒâ€”288, 1951 Kbps, 23.976 fps\nAudio: English, AC3, 448Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 21mn\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5d686dae0ebfd5f4876203d5b1bc48cecd6933","amp;dn":"Madison.County.2011.DVDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5d686dae0ebfd5f4876203d5b1bc48cecd6933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,93,104,109,174,14,191,213,244,135,98,3,213,177,188,72,206,205,105,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
