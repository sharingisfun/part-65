The focus of their concern was the turban. Since the terrorist attacks of the 21st century Sikhs believe their turbans have singled them out for discrimination. In a case of mistaken identity the Sikhs claim they've been wrongly regarded as religious terrorists and subjected to increased airport security searches. \n\nThis documentary traces the history of the turban in the Sikh religion, from its roots in Moghul India, through the battlefields of Europe, to the fight for British Sikhs to wear it without fear. It reveals that the turban is a crucial symbol of the Sikh faith - one that Sikhs will even risk their lives for.\n\nThe Story Of The Turban\n\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 39mn 4s\nBit rate                                 : 1 667 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\n\nAudio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 39mn 4s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 109 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f1e3121c82850398eff32b6e1cfd8a461b8791e","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+Story+Of+The+Turban+-+TVrip+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f1e3121c82850398eff32b6e1cfd8a461b8791e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,30,49,33,200,40,80,57,142,255,50,182,225,207,216,164,97,184,121,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
