Iraq war veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) gained a reputation in his army days as being the go-to guy for tracking down insurgents and deserters and finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Unfortunately one IED found Walter before he could find it, resulting in severe brain damage with a lasting and unexpected effect. Walter transformed from someone skilled at the standard recovery of people and things in wartime scenarios to someone - something - much more extraordinary: a Finder. Walter left the military, but his reputation as a discreet professional able to unearth anything and anyone passed on to generals, politicians and other powerful figures. \n\n\n\nVertaling: Jesse, Quetsbeek en DÃƒÂ©sirÃƒÂ©e\n\n\n\nSeizoen 1 Aflevering 10: The Conversation\n\nWhen a family employs Walter to find their missing father and husband, the only help they can offer is a partial voicemail recording of his last message to them. Also, LeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memories of his deceased wife and daughter bring new meaning to the case and the family theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to reunite.\n\n\n\n\nDeze serie wordt u aangeboden door het DutchReleaseTeam.\nVoor de reviews van de nieuwste films, muziek, series, games etc\nga dan eens naar http://www.hetmultimediacafe.be/\n\n\nKijk ook eens op http://filmtutorials.nl, tutorials over oa converteren, ondertiteling toevoegen en nog veel meer!\n\nDutchReleaseteam = Hardcoded Dutch Subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b122f0599ccee40b3f7549a75d6c74ab70a289","amp;dn":"The+Finder+S01E10+HDTV+Nl+subs+DutchReleaseTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b122f0599ccee40b3f7549a75d6c74ab70a289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,177,34,240,89,156,206,228,11,63,117,73,167,93,108,116,171,112,162,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
