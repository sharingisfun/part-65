It shocks me that it's never gotten a DVD release, especially considering how popular the director's &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is. Sadly, there's a copyright issue with the music, and the chances are pretty great that this will never make it to DVD. Up until now, the only thing I had was my hard-copy VHS, and a terrible looking VHSRiP that's been floating around the net for some years now. I discovered that it was on netflix instant streaming, in decent quality, not perfect, but much better than the VHS, and it's subsiquent rip. A quick capture, and encode, and here's a really solid(IMO) webrip of one of my favorite comedies of all time. Like I said, the quality isn't perfect, but it's definitely watchable, and much better than anything else that's been made available. Enjoy the show. :)\n\nEncoder: thefuzz\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRespects to CaptainHomey, Cyanide, CM8, Rx, THC, ELEKTRI4KA, Killerhz, XtremE, PA, YeFsTe and everyone in the struggle...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c0714baeca1cd7fb915ec26ca2e79ea1972982f","amp;dn":"subUrbia.1996.WEBRiP.XviD-SiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c0714baeca1cd7fb915ec26ca2e79ea1972982f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,7,20,186,236,161,205,127,185,21,236,38,202,46,121,234,25,114,152,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
