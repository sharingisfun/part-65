I have taken a lot of my own personal time to put this whole torrent together so I just hope that you will comment what you think about it and tell your freinds about it. I would also like it if you could take the time to seed this. If you have any suggestions on what I should add just comment below so I can make this even better for the rest of the community. Thanks for taking the time to read this.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThis is a compilation of all of the most functional RuneScape macros and bots as of April 25, 2012. I have included instructions on how each bot is to be set up for best performance &amp; results.\n\nI take no credibility for any development of the bots featured in my compilation. I did however, include every script that I have personally purchased up to this date. The scripts that I have purchased can be found in the RSBot folder, as RSBot is the client that the paid scripts will work for.\nUPDATE: I will re-include the scripts when they are functional. RSBot is currently in its beta stage of development, rendering all scripts nonfunctional.\n\nThe bots featured in my compilation are as follows:\n\nRSBot\nEpicBot\nSimba- Simba scripts can be found here: http://villavu.com/\n\nUpon the completion of your download, please make sure to seed, and leave feedback for how I can make future improvements to it's organization/addition of more paid scripts/etc.\n\nThank you &amp; stay tuned, as I will be making consistent releases to keep up with the flow of bot &amp; script updates. Please bookmark my profile to be notified of my releases!\n\n- Coolcrazyfly\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db77c357f529e790eb155bbb9a5c31489a85eec9","amp;dn":"RuneScape+Macros+Updated+%5B04%2F25%2F2012%5D+%5BCoolcrazyfly%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db77c357f529e790eb155bbb9a5c31489a85eec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,119,195,87,245,41,231,144,235,21,91,187,154,92,49,72,154,133,238,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
