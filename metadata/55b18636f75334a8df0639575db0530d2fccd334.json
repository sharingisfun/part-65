This is not the NHL Playoffs, this is Postmedia Canspell 2012: Spelling Night in Canada - a one-hour prime-time event that will celebrate excellence in our young people and keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Spelling Night in Canada airs Sunday, April 1 at 7 p.m. (7:30 NT) on CBC Television.\n\nOpen to students from Grade 4 to Grade 8, the 8th annual Postmedia Canspell competition began when a quarter of a million young Canadians took part in school spelling bees in January. From there, 21 finalists from schools across the country are squaring off for Spelling Night in Canada.\n\nNew to this year's broadcast, the audience will have the chance to play along to find out if they can spell better than an eighth grader. To engage live, viewers can log into their Twitter accounts, listen to the words on television and reply to @SpellingNight with the correct spelling of the word. The person who spells the most words correctly during the course of the broadcast will win a prize. Players will also be able to see how many words they spelled correctly, and how they measure up against the rest of Canada.\n\nThe winning super-speller will receive a $7,500 education award, courtesy of Egg Farmers of Canada. The second and third place spellers will receive $5,000 and $2,500 respectively, also courtesy EFC.  All three top spellers will go to represent Canada and their hometowns internationally at the renowned Scripps Bee in Washington, D.C. in June.\n\nThe 8th annual Postmedia Canspell National Spelling Bee Final takes place on Wednesday, March 28 at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in downtown Toronto where it will be taped in front of a live studio audience. Canadians can witness the edge-of-your-seat competition by tuning into Spelling Night in Canada on April 1 at 7 p.m. (7:30 NT).\n\n\n\nFile                  : canspell.2012.spelling.night.in.canada.2012-04-01.hdtv.x264-cldd.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 933 Kbps\nLength            : 314 MiB for 47mn 6s 602ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 755 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 173 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b18636f75334a8df0639575db0530d2fccd334","amp;dn":"canspell.2012.spelling.night.in.canada.2012-04-01.hdtv.x264-cldd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55b18636f75334a8df0639575db0530d2fccd334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,177,134,54,247,83,52,168,223,6,57,87,93,176,83,13,47,204,211,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
