In 1978, he broke out to kill his other sister, Laurie Strode. He killed all of her friends, but she escaped. A few years later, she faked her death so he couldn't find her. But now, in 1998, Michael has returned and found all the papers he needs to find her. He tracks her down to a private school where she has gone under a new name with her son, John. And now, Laurie must do what she should have done a long time ago and finally decided to hunt down the evil one last time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120694/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120694/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bbc41b1c79ff966575e2d0efeb35b05d6592b41","amp;dn":"Halloween+7+%3AH20+%28REQUEST%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bbc41b1c79ff966575e2d0efeb35b05d6592b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,188,65,177,199,159,249,102,87,94,45,14,254,179,91,5,214,89,43,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
