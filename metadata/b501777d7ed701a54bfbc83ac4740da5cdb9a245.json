Since then, refractors have retained their dominance over all types of reflector in studies of the Moon, planets and double stars because of the precision of their optics and lack of a central obstruction in the optical path, which causes diffraction effects in all commercially-made reflectors.\n\nMost mature amateur astronomers got started with a 60mm refractor, or something similar. Thirty years ago, there was little choice available to the hobbyist, but in the last decade long focus crown-flint achromats have moved aside for some exquisitely crafted apochromatic designs offered by leading commercial manufacturers. There has been a huge increase in the popularity of these telescopes in the last few years, led by a significant increase in the number of companies (particularly, William Optics, Orion USA, StellarVue, SkyWatcher and AstroTech) who are now heavily marketing refractors in the amateur astronomical magazines.\n\nIn Choosing and Using a Refracting Telescope, well-known observer and astronomy writer Neil English celebrates the remarkable history and evolution of the refracting telescope and looks in detail at the instruments, their development and their use.\n\nA major feature of this book is the way it compares not only different classes of refractor, but also telescopes of each class that are sold by various commercial manufacturers. The author is perhaps uniquely placed to do this, having used and tested literally hundreds of different refracting telescopes over three decades.\n\nBecause it includes many diverse subjects such as imaging with consumer-level digital cameras, imaging with webcams, and imaging with astronomical CCD cameras ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that are not covered together in equal depth in any other single volume ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Choosing and Using a Refracting Telescope could become the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“refractor bibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for amateur astronomers at all levels, especially those who are interested in imaging astronomical objects of every class.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 296 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (September 29, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1441964029\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1441964021","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b501777d7ed701a54bfbc83ac4740da5cdb9a245","amp;dn":"Choosing+and+Using+a+Refracting+Telescope%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b501777d7ed701a54bfbc83ac4740da5cdb9a245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,1,119,125,126,215,1,165,75,251,200,58,196,116,13,165,205,185,162,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
