Ramadan is not a month of parties and socialising, it is a month of worship. To fast the month of Ramadan is one of the pillars of Islam.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dbc18ff31eeb2ae79e9ee9836ccbd306157fc2c","amp;dn":"Why+Muslims+Love+the+Month+of+Ramadan%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dbc18ff31eeb2ae79e9ee9836ccbd306157fc2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,188,24,255,49,238,178,174,121,233,238,152,54,204,189,48,97,87,252,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
