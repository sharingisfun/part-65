The group consists of three unhappy European football wives, a pretentious drug-addict student, a closet-homosexual football enthusiast, and a kind and gentle struggling author in a wheelchair. Each week they meet to read and discuss a new book, which always affects or influences each of the group's lives in some way. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc9b4d014b7f434b13041947e8a2d03ced58cb30","amp;dn":"The+Bookgroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc9b4d014b7f434b13041947e8a2d03ced58cb30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,155,77,1,75,127,67,75,19,4,25,71,232,162,208,60,237,88,203,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
