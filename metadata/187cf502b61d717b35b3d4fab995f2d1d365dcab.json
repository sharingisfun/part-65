What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 4- sunday - The remaining 21 contestants return to the MasterChef kitchen to compete in a biscuit inspired Mystery Box challenge. Later it's an Invention Test Mexican style. Cactus anyone?\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:187cf502b61d717b35b3d4fab995f2d1d365dcab","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E19.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"187cf502b61d717b35b3d4fab995f2d1d365dcab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,124,245,2,182,29,113,123,53,179,212,250,185,149,242,209,211,101,220,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
