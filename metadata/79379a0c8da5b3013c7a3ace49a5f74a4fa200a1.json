The game expands on the movie plot with additional missions and characters. Unlike its predecessor, Revenge of the Fallen features a hub-like, non-linear mission progression. This allows the player to choose what missions they would like to accomplish and where in order to further drive the story.[2] Multiplayer features five different modes. \\&quot;Deathmatch\\&quot; allows players to choose any character in a free-for-all battle. \\&quot;Team Deathmatch\\&quot; features Autobots vs Decepticons. \\&quot;Control Points\\&quot; features gameplay similar to the Star Wars Battlefront series, with teams battling for control of specific areas to gain points. \\&quot;One Shall Stand\\&quot; is similar to Team Deathmatch; the difference is that the objective is for a player to take out the enemy leader (Optimus Prime or Megatron) while protecting their own. The final mode, \\&quot;Battle for the Shards\\&quot;, features Capture the Flag-style gameplay; teams search \nfor shards of the AllSpark and return them to their base to earn points.[2][3].\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen System Requirements\n\nIntel CPU\t-\tCore 2 Duo E6400 2.13GHz\t\t\nAMD CPU\t-\tAthlon 64 X2 Dual Core 4800+\nNvidia GFX Card\t-\tGeForce 7600 GT 256MB\t\nATI GFX Card\t-\tRadeon X1600\nRAM (Memory)\t-\t 1 GB\t\nHard Disk Space\t-\t 5 GB\nDirect X\t-\t 9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79379a0c8da5b3013c7a3ace49a5f74a4fa200a1","amp;dn":"THE+TRANSFORMERS+-+REVENGE+OF+THE+FALLEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79379a0c8da5b3013c7a3ace49a5f74a4fa200a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,55,154,12,141,165,179,1,60,122,58,206,73,165,247,74,79,162,0,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
