Unfortunately that's the first \nepisode that nobody seems to have. \n\nThis and the next 4 episodes that I previously skipped posting, \nare because they have John in the opening credits. \nHe isn't in any of these though.\n\nWe'll just have to wait till the Season 4 DVD set comes out \nto see the last 14 episodes of that year.\n\n\nGuest Stars --- Ernest Borgnine and Edward Binns","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd775f5f77002ad526d146ede0f517ef28724c82","amp;dn":"WAGON+TRAIN+--+The+Earl+Packer+Story+%28+with+Ernest+Borgnine+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd775f5f77002ad526d146ede0f517ef28724c82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,119,95,95,119,0,42,213,38,209,70,237,224,245,23,239,40,114,76,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
