Wolverine is a mutant, possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical \ncapabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him \nto recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Wolverine[/b]\n================\n\nNo.  Title \tOriginal airdate   English airdate\n---- -------  ------------------- -----------------\n\n07 &quot;Vadhaka&quot; September 9, 2011 \n&quot;ZÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½&quot; (ÃƒÂ¥Ã†â€™Ã‚ï¿½)  February 18, 2011\n\nWhen Vadhaka attacks Logan and Min, she tells him that the statue belongs \nto Hideki Kurohagi and is the spirit of Madripoor, but the statue cannot \nmove unless the seal is removed. As they run, a crazed mob attacks and Logan \ndirects them to a dead end alley way. Logan tries to protect Min, only for a \nrival group to attack the mob that chased the two. As soon as they flee the mobs, the statue intercepts them with Logan using his unbreakable skeleton to shield Min from Vadhaka's fists. Logan brings out his claws on the wall so Min has space to escape as he gets pummeled, but is captured by the locals. Yukio then saves Min with her ring blade, then Wolverine resumes fighting. Vadhaka then kicks Logan into the building behind him and Logan makes his way to fight the former in a more spacious area. Yukio pours quick-drying cement on Vadhaka to give Logan a chance to get out. Thinking that Vadhaka is encased in the cement, Logan and Yukio make their way only for the statue to easily break free and attack. Min arrives and uses a steam pipe that burns her hands to distract Vadhaka long enough for Logan escape far from the battle scene, but with Yukio hidden under debris. In the sewer as Logan tries to leave Min, a group approaches that Min says are her friends. As Logan tries to leave, he catches a knife-tip cane and throws it back. Logan meets Master Koh who offers a trade with Logan. Meanwhile, Kikyo arrives on the island killing four locals who attack him as he searches for Logan. Koh informs Logan that the wedding will be earlier then first thought, and he needs Logan to help win a guerilla war to retake Madripoor. Elsewhere, it turns out that Vadhaka is an A.I.M. robot. Koh tells the story of how Kurohagi Sr. gained control of the island and how he is Yukio's grandfather on her father's side, but Logan does not piece \nthe latter fact together. When the cameras in Koh's base are hijacked, Hideki puts Yukio on screen saying he will kill her if Logan does not surrender. When Koh hears this, he tells Logan that Yukio is his granddaughter.  \n \nSpoken Language: English\n\n[b]Note[/b] This episode must have a lot of minimal animation in it because the bitrate will not go above a certain level no matter how high I set it for manually, I remember having the same problem with the small filesize of these episodes the 1st time I released them with hardcoded subs and they are doing \nthe same thing again now no matter how many times I try recoding with higher bitrates the size stays at about 140mb\n-------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n---------\n[URL=http://img233.imageshack.us/i/wolverine107vadhakaojav.jpg/][IMG]http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/7418/wolverine107vadhakaojav.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 137M\nPlayTime           : 00:19:57.330\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 35884\nVideoBitRate       : 821447\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nHash:\n------\n85085F4C9463898A3C5BB30FE008D152DBB834B4\n--------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace onfor more Cartoons and Anime.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85085f4c9463898a3c5bb30fe008d152dbb834b4","amp;dn":"wolverine+-+107+-+Vadhaka+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85085f4c9463898a3c5bb30fe008d152dbb834b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,8,95,76,148,99,137,138,60,91,179,15,224,8,209,82,219,184,52,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
