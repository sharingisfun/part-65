Glenn Close returns as Patty Hewes and Rose Byrne as Ellen Parsons. John Goodman and Dylan Baker join the cast as series regulars with Chris Messina, Judd Hirsch, Fisher Stevens, Griffin Dunne, Julie White, Bailey Chase, Derek Webster and Zachary Booth (reprising his role as Patty's son) in recurring roles. The show was created and is executive produced by KZK and co-executive produced by Mark A. Baker.\n\nThe fourth season finds Patty and Ellen embroiled in a wrongful-death suit against a private military contractor, Howard T. Erickson (John Goodman). Erickson has made a fortune supplying the U.S. Government with security forces in Afghanistan and is protected by his connections within the highest echelons of power in Washington, D.C. Chris Sanchez (Chris Messina), a decorated soldier who now works for the security firm is drawn into the web of intrigue when Ellen and Patty set their sights on his corrupt employer. Complicating matters is Jerry Boorman (Dylan Baker), a shadowy opportunist with ties to both Erickson and the Middle East who is intimately involved in the season-long conspiracy at the heart of the lawsuit. Griffin Dunne plays a foreign correspondent whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looking to write a story about the embattled company, Bailey Chase plays Ellen Parson's love interest and Judd Hirsch as an old mentor of Patty's.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/a/a2/Damages_-_Logo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/a/a2/Damages_-_Logo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Crediti :.\n\nAnno: 2011\nGenere: legale, thriller\nNumero episodi: 10\nDurata episodi: 40/58\n\nGlenn Close: Patty Hewes\nRose Byrne: Ellen Parkinson\nTate Donovan: Tom Shayes\nTed Danson: Arthur Frobisher\nÃ…Â½eljko Ivanek: Ray Fiske\nNoah Bean: David Connor\nAnastasia Griffith: Katie Connor\nMarcia Gay Harden: Claire Maddox\nTimothy Olyphant: Wes Krulik\nWilliam Hurt: Daniel Purcell\nCampbell Scott: Joseph Tobin\nMartin Short: Leonard Winstone\nJohn Goodman: Howard T.
