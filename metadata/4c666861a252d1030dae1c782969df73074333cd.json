This program sheds new light on the audacious escape of 76 Allied airment from a Nazi POW camp during World War II.\n\nSixty years after the event, NOVA follows a team of archeologists as they search the site of Stalag Luft III for new evidence of the clandestine operation, which involved 600 prisoners digging three highly sophisticated tunnels, code-named Tom, Dick, and Harry.  Each tunnel was made with railways, electric lights, and underground air pumps-- all under the noses of German guards.\n\nThe detainees were planning to spring 200 men via Harry on the moonless night of March 24, 1944.
