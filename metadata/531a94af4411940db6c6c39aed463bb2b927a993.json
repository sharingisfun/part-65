Darker and more twisted than ever, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get ChuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d TourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is Master Ventriloquist David StrassmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 3rd release taking you to the edge of comic madness and exploring dysfunctional relationships with the wildest cast imaginableÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.. Chuck Wood is back Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in full force! Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the foul mouthed, argumentative dummy. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a surprise for Strassman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s having an affair with another ventriloquist, The Great Ventrini, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to walk. The soft and cuddly Ted E. Bare, as anxious as ever, retreats into his fantasy world. Of course all your favourite characters are back: Kevin the Alien, Senile Grandpa Fred and the Hack Comic, Sid the Beaver. Sharing the stage with A.N.G.E.L, his first ever female character, Strassman brings them all to life with hilarious and spooky reality. Hilarious and brilliantly performed!\n\n.. Sorry that its in FLV format &amp; not all in one file, i dont hsve time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:531a94af4411940db6c6c39aed463bb2b927a993","amp;dn":"Strassman+Live+Vol.+3+-+Get+Chuck%27d+Tour+%28FLV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"531a94af4411940db6c6c39aed463bb2b927a993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,26,148,175,68,17,148,13,182,198,195,154,237,70,59,178,185,39,169,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
