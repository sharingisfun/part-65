This movie is not a remake, however, Ki-bÃ…ï¿½ has appeared already in the 1992 film, Nobita and the Kingdom of Clouds. The name Ki-bÃ…ï¿½ comes from the words &quot;Ki&quot; (Ã¦Å“Â¨?) meaning tree, and &quot;BÃ…ï¿½&quot; (Ã¥ï¿½Å ?) meaning boy. The word Ki-bÃ…ï¿½ also comes from the word &quot;KibÃ…ï¿½&quot; (Ã¥Â¸Å’Ã¦Å“â€º?), which means hope. The catch phrase of this movie is &quot;Ã¥Æ’â€¢Ã£â€šâ€°Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¥Â¸Å’Ã¦Å“â€ºÃ£ï¿½Å’Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¦ï¿½Â¥Ã£â€šâ€™Ã¥â€¹â€¢Ã£ï¿½â€¹Ã£ï¿½â„¢&quot; (our hope moves the future), which Ki-bÃ…ï¿½'s name can be referred to. Voices of Roku-chan and Moya-kun were done by anonymous children who were chosen.\n\nThe film was illustrated as manga on the February and March edition of CoroCoro Comic. Then it was released as the 25th film tankÃ…ï¿½bon, which may be bought at the theater. As the 4th &quot;Sega=Doraemon&quot; project, an action-adventure game was also released on March 6, 2008, two days before the release of the film.
