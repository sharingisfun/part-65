In nine chapters it brings together a massive amount of archaeological, literary, and epigraphic information under one cover. It also contains a full catalogue of all known Roman theatres, including a number of odea (concert halls) and bouleuteria (council chambers) which are relevant to the architectural discussion, about 1,000 entries in all. Inscriptional or literary evidence relating to each theatre is listed and there is an up-to-date bibliography for each building. Most importantly the book contains plans of over 500 theatres or buildings of theatrical type, as well as numerous text figures and nearly 200 figures and plates.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 534 pages\n    * Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA (September 21, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0198144695\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0198144694","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a830827b468315873d5a315ea8efa60baa85de1c","amp;dn":"Roman+Theatres%3A+An+Architectural+Study%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a830827b468315873d5a315ea8efa60baa85de1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,48,130,123,70,131,21,135,61,90,49,94,168,239,166,11,170,133,222,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
