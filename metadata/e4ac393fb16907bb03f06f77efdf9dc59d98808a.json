He wakes up trapped in the dark, cramped trunk of a moving car with no recollection of how or why he's there. The only light comes from the blood-red digital numbers ticking away above his head that signify one thing--he's running out of time. As the captors reveal themselves and their motives while torturing their hostage mentally and physically, Jeremy realizes he is a pawn in their potentially catastrophic plot. He will not be set free until he gives up information about the President he's been trained not to reveal.\n\n\n\nTitle ______________ Brake\nSource _____________ Blu-ray\nRelease ____________ 05-06-2012\nRipper _____________ Zoo\nRuntime ____________ 01:31:19\nVideo ______________ x264 @ 2,154 Kbps\nAudio ______________ AC3 6CH @ 448 Kbps\nResolution _________ 1280 x 720\nGenre ______________ Crime | Thriller\nLanguage ___________ English\nSubtitle ___________ N/A","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ac393fb16907bb03f06f77efdf9dc59d98808a","amp;dn":"Brake.2012.720p.BDRip.x264.AC3-Zoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ac393fb16907bb03f06f77efdf9dc59d98808a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,172,57,63,177,105,7,187,3,240,111,119,239,223,157,197,157,152,128,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
