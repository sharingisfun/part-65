The artist Alex Grey, who has evoked awe, rapture, and controversy over the past 20 years, is our preeminent explorer of this deep realm where creativity and divinity merge. On The Visionary Artist, Grey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first work on audio, he personally guides us to these mystical places through a full curriculum of intensive, mind-expanding visualizations.\n\nA longtime student of meditation, shamanism, and transpersonal psychology, Grey leads listeners up and down the ladder of consciousness to retrieve the transcendental visions our souls are constantly painting. From exercises on form, color, and imageryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to the energetic structures of realityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to the universal source of all creation, Grey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s system for artistic exploration guides us along the sacred path of art, while dissolving the boundaries of reality along the way.\n\nArtists in virtually any discipline will appreciate Grey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s view of art as a revelatory and healing force. The Visionary Artist plunges us into a mystery that is at least 40,000 years old: the true mission of art in human experience.\n\n------------\n\nPublisher: Sounds True\nYear: 2000\nRun Time: 3hrs 15 min\nFormat: Mp3\nBit Rate: 128kbps\n\n------------\n\nThis is my first ever original torrent upload.
