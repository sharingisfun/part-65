In it, alleged details about an &quot;Xbox 720.&quot; For starters, the 56-page document claims the next-generation Xbox will launch in 2013 for $299, alongside the &quot;Kinect V2.&quot; The doc also claims it'll come packed with Blu-ray functionality and be able to play game that are &quot;4x - 6x&quot; better looking than Xbox 360. If only it could promise the game themselves would be 4x - 6x better!\nBeyond the stuff you'd expect, the document also claims Microsoft has Augmented Reality glasses in the works named &quot;Fortaleza&quot; (presumably built at Brazil-based Innovation Center Fortaleza) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the document says we won't see through MS' AR until some time in 2014, post-console launch. Additionally, it claims the &quot;Xbox 720&quot; will have some form of &quot;always on&quot; functionality, as well as the ability to run apps at the same time (read: multitasking).\nNow before you go getting all excited, you should probably know that this document surfaced in some form back in early May on Nukezilla. Moreover, even if it's totally legit, the document itself appears to be rather old Ã¢â‚¬â€œ dating back to August 2010 at least. That said, some of the info detailed in the document has since been announced by Microsoft (most notably Smart Glass). We've seen some pretty thorough fakes in our time, but this would be the most thorough if it were.\nWe've reached out to Microsoft for comment, but, well, you know.\nUpdate: The document was removed from Scribd due to copyright infringement, at the request of a law firm named Covington and Burling. The firm worked with Microsoft as recently as this past April, when it advised Microsoft in its patent settlement case with Facebook. Microsoft still hasn't responded to request for comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94da3ba923bfb7a40b60f83c0725fe9e7c3de2f4","amp;dn":"+Xbox+720+Microsoft+Leak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94da3ba923bfb7a40b60f83c0725fe9e7c3de2f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,218,59,169,35,191,183,164,11,96,248,60,7,37,254,158,124,61,226,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
