To play the games on the actual console, you will need a Starcraft Supercharger(I got mine off of Ebay). to play them on an emulator, you need a program that can convert the audio files to bin format, i believe.\n\n     the reason the games are in audio format is because they were originally on cassette tapes and played through a cassette player. These can be burned to an audio cd and played with a conventional cd-player. to burn to a AUDIO CD, you can use windows media player, or I use the program IMG BURN. \n\nIn Img Burn (my version is 2.5.5), click MODE on the top, go to WRITE, and click the CD with the music note on it. if you hover over it, it will say &quot;create cue file&quot;. which is what we want to do. browse and select all the audio supercharger games, and create cue. after that you can use img bur to burn the CUE file itself, or any other image burning software. \n\n     good luck :) i've played these games for hours on end on my atari 2600 JR :D    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97216e3bc22972d2abf8d8a3b96b12e88f865f62","amp;dn":"Cyberpunk+Stella+Gets+a+New+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97216e3bc22972d2abf8d8a3b96b12e88f865f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,33,110,59,194,41,114,210,171,248,216,163,185,107,18,232,143,134,95,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
