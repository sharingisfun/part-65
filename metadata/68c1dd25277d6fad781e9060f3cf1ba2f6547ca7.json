Specifically, they put their hopes on Horace P. Bogardus, a businessman who has built a modern \nbuilding right next door to the school and who they hope will donate his new \nedifice to them.\n\ngamblemad: I uploaded this because Ingrid Bergman (1915Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1982) was\n           amazing in this film.  Without her performance this would not\n           have been nominated for the Oscar (my opinion only).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c1dd25277d6fad781e9060f3cf1ba2f6547ca7","amp;dn":"The+Bells+of+St.+Mary%27s+%281945%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c1dd25277d6fad781e9060f3cf1ba2f6547ca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,193,221,37,39,125,111,173,120,30,144,96,243,207,27,162,246,84,124,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
