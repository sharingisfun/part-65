The\nthird part of a trilogy that also includes 2006's Sound The Alarm and 2007's\nUnder The Boards, Daybreak sees singer/guitarist Chris Conley moving past\nthe anger and frustration that has defined the band's last two albums and\nrediscovering a sense of wonder with the world that he can't wait to share\nwith his listeners. Whether you've followed his music since Saves The Day's\nHardcore '90s output or are a recent convert to the band, you'll still be\nable to enjoy the album as a singular statement on what it means to let go.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09b4672e1e2df6a998691f779866a047dc08772","amp;dn":"Saves_The_Day-Daybreak-%28Deluxe_Edition%29-2CD-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09b4672e1e2df6a998691f779866a047dc08772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,155,70,114,225,226,223,106,153,134,145,247,121,134,106,4,125,192,135,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
