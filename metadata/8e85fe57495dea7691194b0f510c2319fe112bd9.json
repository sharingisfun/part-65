Tommy has to struggle with the loss of his cousin and best friend Jimmy Keefe, who died on September 11, 2001, and frequently visits Tommy in visions. In the pilot episode, Tommy and his wife have already separated and Tommy has moved across the street. He is ill-tempered, self-destructive, hypocritical, manipulative, and a relapsed alcoholic. Despite his devotion and care for others, he is viewed by various family members and his fellow firefighters as self-centered.\n\n\nFind the all other seasons and a list of episodes here:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=669626#pid669626&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=669626#pid669626&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t350 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t42 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :   \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t9 + 2 Teaser + 1 txt = 12\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e85fe57495dea7691194b0f510c2319fe112bd9","amp;dn":"Rescue+Me+-+Season+7+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e85fe57495dea7691194b0f510c2319fe112bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,133,254,87,73,93,234,118,145,25,75,15,81,12,35,25,254,17,43,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
