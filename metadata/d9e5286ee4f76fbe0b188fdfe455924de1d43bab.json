More than 900 cases are being investigated, but new cases are still coming to light - lawyers say the total could reach 300,000.\n\nHow long? Over a period of 40-50 years, beginning under Franco, up to the 1990s\n\nWho benefited? Initially the Fascists by bringing up the children of their enemies - later children were taken from parents judged to be morally or economically deficient and placed with approved Catholic, often childless, families.\n\nWhy did it take so long to expose? The Church and medical profession are highly respected, and Spanish law does not require the biological mother's name on the birth certificate\n\nThe scale of the baby trafficking was unknown until this year, when two men - Antonio Barroso and Juan Luis Moreno, childhood friends from a seaside town near Barcelona - discovered that they had been bought from a nun. Their parents weren't their real parents, and their life had been built on a lie.\n\nAfter months of requests from the BBC, the Spanish government finally put forward Angel Nunez from the justice ministry to talked about Spain's stolen children.\n\n\nFile: Our World Spains Stolen Babies.avi\nSource:UKNova\nCapp: The Eagle\n\n\nshunster\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9e5286ee4f76fbe0b188fdfe455924de1d43bab","amp;dn":"Spain%27s+Stolen+Babies-2012+05+1C+Our+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9e5286ee4f76fbe0b188fdfe455924de1d43bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,229,40,110,228,247,111,190,11,24,143,223,228,85,146,77,225,212,59,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
