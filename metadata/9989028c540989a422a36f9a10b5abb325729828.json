Overall, I think this is the best version currently available.\n\nI've left in the Japanese-language end credits for the first movie. Adding in the American ones wouldn't have worked well on account of TV announcements, and their overall style, I think, adds on well to the last scene.\n\nThe first movie in the Japanese version included a long (and beautiful) montage of Takato, Kai, and Guilmon spending time around the island.\nUnfortunately, leaving this in would not have worked on account of differing audio shifts. I've left this scene as a separate extra.\nOriginally, it took place right between Rika and Renamon's first battle and Kai, Takato, and the digimon eating some fish.\n\nFor the second movie's end credits, again, audio overlaps didn't allow for a clean attachment. Also, the final scene concludes with a sorrowful and satisfying tone that I at least think would completely clash with the ensuing happy pop from the Japanese version. I've left these credits in as an extra, though.\n\nTORRENT INCLUDES:\n1. Digimon Tamers: Battle of Adventures\n2. Digimn Tamers: Runaway Locomon\n3. Island Montage from Movie 5\n4. Japanese End Credits from Movie 6\n\nIf you enjoy this, please seed! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9989028c540989a422a36f9a10b5abb325729828","amp;dn":"DIGIMON+TAMERS+MOVIES+%26mdash%3B+5+Battle+of+Adventures+%2B+6+Runaway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9989028c540989a422a36f9a10b5abb325729828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,137,2,140,84,9,137,164,34,163,111,154,16,181,171,179,37,114,152,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
