The sunlight shining through the windows but the streets eerily silent, Julio (JuliÃƒÂ¡n VillagrÃƒÂ¡n) and Julia (Michelle Jenner) are attempting to navigate the awkward aftermath of a drunken one-night stand when they notice a massive U.F.O. hovering ominously over the city. It seems that all of the tenants in the building have vanished without a trace, along with most of the people in the city save for JuliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portly, prying neighbor Ãƒï¿½ngel (Carlos Areces). Later, when JuliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boyfriend Carlos (Raul Cimas) shows up, an awkward game of deception emerges as Julia and Julio attempt to keep their fling a secret. But when Ãƒï¿½ngel catches wind of the affair, the dynamics in the apartment begin to shift. Desperate, Julia and Julio hatch a plan to get Ãƒï¿½ngel out of the picture, and ensure that Carlos remains none the wiser. Unfortunately for the conniving couple, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easier said than done and before long human conflict begins to take precedence over the strange events unfolding outside. \n\nGenre: Comedy | Drama | Sci-Fi \nIMDB Rating: 6.3/10 from 373 users \nDirected by: Nacho Vigalondo \nStarring: Michelle Jenner, Carlos Areces and JuliÃƒÂ¡n VillagrÃƒÂ¡n \n\nRelease Name: Extraterrestrial.2011.VODRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-AXED \nSize: 1.13 GB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”272, 1301 Kbps, 23.976 fps \nAudio: Spanish, AC3, 384 Kbps \nRuntime: 1h 34mn \nSubtitle: Hard Coded English subtitles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:306732f5f1e9703e9e386ef91da2902926bfbeab","amp;dn":"Extraterrestrial.2011.VODRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-AXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"306732f5f1e9703e9e386ef91da2902926bfbeab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,103,50,245,241,233,112,62,158,56,110,249,29,162,144,41,38,191,190,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
