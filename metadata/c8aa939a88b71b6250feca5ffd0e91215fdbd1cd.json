Well, we will see on this edition of the B Movie Show!\n\n\nNASA scientist Tom Reynolds thought everything would be fine when he moved to Seattle to be with his fiancÃƒÂ©, Navy Lieutenant Emma Peterson. But when his gearhead son Wyatt can't stop fighting with her green-minded daughter Chloe, they realize that this new family may not make it. And things aren't just stormy on the home front; when an unidentified object is shot down by the military and crashes into Puget Sound, it sets off a series of strange weather phenomena: earthquakes, tornados, lightning storms... and they're spreading. Now, this new family must find a way to work together to save the city, and each other, before it's too late.
