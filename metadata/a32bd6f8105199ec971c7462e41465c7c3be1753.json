Episode 10 is also much larger than the other episodes and is also a different format, this is because I personally taped this episode directly off TV onto a DVD recorder, whereas the other episodes are pc converted. Also within the episode 10 fie is a movie called the castle of cagliostro sorry if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like this movie, but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know how to separate the two files, so its all or nothing iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m afraid. \n\nAswell as all that, iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve included some pre production photos give to a dare to believe member by Tim Scott himself which include some previously unreleased episode images, and a few documents covering a couple of interviews from some of the cast of dare to believe, kindly provided by the nice folks at www.aguamoose.co.uk. \n\nAs far as the quality goes with the actual series episodes, the quality isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly high def, they are directly copied from TV to VHS then converted into AVI files and compressed, so the quality is pretty low, also as they are from old VHS cassettes they are a little crusty and on a couple of episodes the signal reception must have been pretty poor as there is some break up. \n\nUnfortunately this is the most complete dare to believe torrent your gonna find out there, I hope you like it, and please seed as long as possible. Thanks.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32bd6f8105199ec971c7462e41465c7c3be1753","amp;dn":"Dare+lieve+ITV+Surreal+Comedy+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32bd6f8105199ec971c7462e41465c7c3be1753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,43,214,248,16,81,153,236,151,28,116,98,228,20,101,199,195,190,23,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
