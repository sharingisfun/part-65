For the past seven years, Lelung Rinpoche has been living in Ruislip North London, in the garden shed of one of his students. He runs a dharma or teaching centre locally, attended by British followers. Now a British passport holder, he embarks on a mission to find previous Lelungs' teachings, and the teachers who hold the key to unlocking their secrets. His odyssey takes him to India, Mongolia and China as he tries to find a way of getting back home to Tibet. He meets some of Tibetan Buddhism's most senior teachers, including the Tibetan Prime Minister in exile.   Lelung is a young, modern lama, with relationships with many across the globe from teenagers in Rusilip to the Dalai Lama. The film includes an interview with Tibetan Buddhist expert Professor Robert Thurman, father of Uma Thurman. Lelung Rinpoche has a daunting task to complete on his quest to recover lost teachings before they disappear, and to try to take the right steps on his own path towards enlightenment.\n\n\n- - -\nScreenshots\n- - - &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/gakkdaadc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/gakkdaadc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n- - -\nURL\n- - -        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0152d29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0152d29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n- - -\nTechnical Details\n- - -\nGeneral\nUnique ID                                : 191269071166751651616836150775583612534 (0x8FE51549F13246626013C82EADD41E76)\nComplete name                            : BBC.2011.Buddha.in.Suburbia.720p_x264_aac.mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 1.06 GiB\nDuration                                 : 58mn 8s\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 602 Kbps\nMovie name                               : &quot;Buddha in Suburbia&quot;\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2011-09-19 20:37:44\nWriting application                      : mkvmerge v4.9.1 ('Ich will') built on Jul 11 2011 22:36:43\nWriting library                          : Lavf53.12.0\nOriginal source form                     : DIG\nTITLE                                    : Buddha in Suburbia\nLAW_RATING                               : clean\nSUMMARY                                  : The journey of Lelung Rinpoche, one of Tibetan Buddhism's three principal reincarnations, as he gathers the lost teachings of his faith and attempts a return to his homeland.\nKEYWORDS                                 : Factual,Life Stories,Religion &amp; Ethics\nCOMMENT                                  : &quot;Recorded by Aularon.&quot;\nDESCRIPTION                              : &quot;The extraordinary journey of Lelung Rinpoche as he gathers the lost teachings of his faith&quot;\nARTIST                                   : Buddha in Suburbia\nSYNOPSIS                                 : &quot;Buddha in Suburbia tracks the extraordinary journey of 40 year old Lelung Rinpoche, one of Tibetan Buddhism's three principal reincarnations, as he sets out to gather the lost teachings of his faith and to attempt a return to his homeland.
