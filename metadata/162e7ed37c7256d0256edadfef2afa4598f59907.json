But when his first love appears out of the blue, he suddenly starts to question his life. Can they go back to what they had all those years ago?\n\nThere is nothing really wrong with Paul's life; he has a lovely wife, a baby boy, a nice house... He just considers it a bit ordinary, a bit lacking in excitement. Then he catches sight of a girl on his way to work and feels an instant attraction - could this really be love at first sight? He cannot stop\n\nHolly is a young unfulfilled teacher who is in an unsatisfactory relationship with a married man. She suddenly finds herself drawn to one of her female pupils, who appears to feel the same way.\n\nWhen Sandra's youngest child leaves home, she realises that her marriage has become stale; she and her husband have little to say to one another, and he is having an affair. Then she meets someone who somehow makes her feel alive again - has she really found her soulmate, and how will her husband feel now that the shoe is on the other foot?\n\nAdrian is a divorcee who has been searching for true love. It has not been easy, but he is not giving up. Still a romantic, he believes in it whole-heartedly, despite his failed marriage. Just when he thinks he might have found it, he finds that he is the victim of another obsessive love that threatens to scupper his future.\n\n\nTrue Love - S01 - E01 - Nick\nTrue Love - S01 - E02 - Paul\nTrue Love - S01 - E03 - Holly\nTrue Love - S01 - E04 - Sandra\nTrue Love - S01 - E05 - Adrian\n_____________________________________________________\n\nVideo\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 29mn 18s\nBit rate                                 : 1 551 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 29mn 18s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 105 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162e7ed37c7256d0256edadfef2afa4598f59907","amp;dn":"True+Love+-+Series+01+-+TVrips+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162e7ed37c7256d0256edadfef2afa4598f59907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,46,126,211,124,114,86,208,37,110,218,223,239,42,250,69,152,245,153,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
