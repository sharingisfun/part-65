The goals of this authored volume are:\n * to present an accessible overview of the basic properties and principles of Rasch analysis, that does not require a sophisticated statistical background;\n * to demonstrate how Rasch analysis can be applied to generic problems encountered by psychologists and educators; and\n * to prepare readers for performing their own analyses and interpreting the results.\n\nThis book is ideal for researchers in the human sciences interested in learning how to implement the Rasch model with their own data.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd3925d9fcef729f55783fbadae67f25aae16241","amp;dn":"Applying+the+Rasch+Model","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd3925d9fcef729f55783fbadae67f25aae16241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,57,37,217,252,239,114,159,85,120,63,186,218,230,127,37,170,225,98,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
