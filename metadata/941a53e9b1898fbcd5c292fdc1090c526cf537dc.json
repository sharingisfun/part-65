The greatest threat lies in Persia to the east, where the massing forces of the Sassanid Empire loom with fiery menace. There the isolated Roman citadel of Arete awaits inevitable invasion.\n\nOne man is sent to marshal the defences and shore up crumbling walls. A man whose name itself means war: a man called Ballista. Alone, Ballista is called to muster the forces and the courage to stand first and to stand hard against the greatest enemy ever to confront the Imperium.\n\nThis is part one of Warrior of Rome: an epic of empire, of heroes, of treachery, of courage, and most of all, a story of brutal bloody warfare. \n\nBook 2\n\nAD256 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the spectre of treachery hangs ominously over the Roman world. The sparks of Christian fervour have spread through the empire like wildfire, and the imperium is alive with the machinations of dangerous and powerful men.\n\nAll the while, Sassanid forces press forward relentlessly along the eastern frontier. The battle-bloodied general Ballista returns to the imperial court from the fallen city of Arete ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ only to find that there are those who would rather see him dead than alive.\n\nBallista is soon caught in a sinister web of intrigue and religious fanaticism . . . his courage and loyalty will be put to the ultimate test in the service of Rome and the emperor. \n\nbook 3\n\nMesopotamia, AD 260\n\nBetrayed by his most trusted adviser, the Roman Emperor Valerian has been captured by the Sassanid barbarians. The shame of the vanquished beats down mercilessly like the white sun, as the frail old emperor prostrates himself before Sharpur, King of Kings.\n\nBallista looks on helplessly, but vows under his breath to avenge those who have brought the empire to the brink of destruction with their treachery. One day, maybe not soon, but one day, I will kill you . . . But first he must decide what price he will pay for his own freedom.\n\nOnly the fearless and only those whom the gods will spare from hell can now save the empire from a catastrophic ending.\n\nBallista, the Warrior of Rome, faces his greatest challenge yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:941a53e9b1898fbcd5c292fdc1090c526cf537dc","amp;dn":"Warrior+Of+Rome+%5B3+books%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"941a53e9b1898fbcd5c292fdc1090c526cf537dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,26,83,233,177,137,143,188,213,194,146,253,193,9,12,82,108,245,55,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
