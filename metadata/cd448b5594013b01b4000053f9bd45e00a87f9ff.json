Research shows that dysfunctional pathways continue for extended periods even after a minor concussion. Until the consequences of short-term perturbations and long-term residual brain dysfunctions are better understood, concussions must be treated with respect and given a higher priority for continued research activity.\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nMild traumatic brain injury continues to plague athletes of all sports. The clinical scenario at times does not reflect the injury or mechanisms and, as such, the pathophysiology, pathomechanics and pathopsychology of a concussion continue to be the major areas for further research. A lack of understanding of these pathologies has led to controversial recommendations for return to play, as well as an underestimation of true brain injury severity.\n\nA major take-home point from this book should be the assumption that symptom resolution does not necessarily mean injury resolution. As can be seen by research focusing on global metabolic cascades and neural activity of the brain, long-standing dysfunctional pathways continue to exist for extended periods of time even after a minor concussion. Until we completely understand the consequences of short-term perturbations and long-term residual brain dysfunctions, concussions must be treated with respect and given a higher priority for continued research activity.\n\nIncreasing public awareness concerning the dangers of this often underestimated injury will hopefully increase funding for research, allowing investigators around the world to achieve a complete understanding of these pathological processes. Foundations of Sport-Related Brain Injuries is organized into five parts:\n\n    * Mechanisms of Concussion: From Brain to Behavior\n\n    * Evaluation of Sport-Related Concussions\n\n    * Neuroimaging of Traumatic Brain Injury\n\n    * Empirical Findings of Concussion along Life-Span\n\n    * Clinical Coverage of Sport-Related Concussions\n\n    *\n\nThis reference book provides the cumulative effort of world-known experts in the field to summarize current insights and controversies about concussions in athletics. Therefore, this book is an ideal resource for clinical practitioners, coaches, researchers and students interested in kinesiology, psychology, exercise, neuroscience, and sport medicine.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 504 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (May 3, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0387325646\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0387325644","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd448b5594013b01b4000053f9bd45e00a87f9ff","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Sport+Related+Brain+Injuries%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd448b5594013b01b4000053f9bd45e00a87f9ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,68,139,85,148,1,59,1,180,0,0,83,249,189,69,224,10,135,249,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
