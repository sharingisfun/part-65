Their Project       \n     Runway experience begins straight away as they discover a note      \n    from Megan and Alex inviting them to a garden party at Ripponlea     \n    House &amp; Gardens. They dont have to wait long before being given     \n   their first challenge - to create a glamorous cocktail party frock    \n     that expresses who they are as a designer. In a Project Runway      \n     first, the designers are given the opportunity to choose their      \n     models, but they are told to choose wisely, as there is more to     \n   this decision than meets the eye. Camilla Franks joins the judging    \n            panel to help decide who makes the cut this week.            \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n            &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.arenatv.com.au/project-runway/home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.arenatv.com.au/project-runway/home/&lt;/a&gt;              \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                \n             \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                    \n                                             \n                                              \n                                                      \n                                                         \n                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n                \n                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n      My paytv cappin box died...temp fixed for now!  yay!!
