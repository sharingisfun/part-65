I DVRed them on a DIRECTV old standard format (4x3), then output them to the computer for editing, so the resolution is pretty low to start.  Then I removed the commercials and shrunk the videos further to simple MPeg format to fit on a tablet device.  MY kid was a fan of the show, so I'm putting these out there hoping to renew its popularity so maybe some other network will eventually pick up the show and start running the entire series again.  Please enjoy and share share share.\n\nEpisodes are:\nOn Thin Ice / Toxic Mutant Millipede\nNightmare on Locust Lane / The Mummy's Curse\nAre You Afraid of the Moths / Revenge of the Water Bug\nCreepie and the Candy Factory / The Ice Bug Cometh\n\nLet me know if there's a problem with the format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f384522fa7a39e663a7878d06b62687b651b9f79","amp;dn":"Growing+Up+Creepie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f384522fa7a39e663a7878d06b62687b651b9f79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,132,82,47,167,163,158,102,58,120,120,208,107,98,104,123,101,27,159,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
