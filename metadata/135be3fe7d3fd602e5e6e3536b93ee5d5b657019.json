So why not an addition to the list. Yes why not.\n\nSo i made an addition. A compilation of rock / indie tracks ready to go public. The additional list: Opportunity is what I call Bar proof.\n\n\nEnjoy (incl. the best cover so far)\n\n\n\n\nBackground.\n\nThis download is meant for people (like me) who hate (or have no time) going through various Indie playlists every month. Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.\n\n@1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.\n@2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).\n@3. The ones I like myself and do not fit in one of the above categories.\n\n\nVHQ (Very High Quality).\n\nOnly the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.\n\nEnjoy and keep the Indie spirit high (by promoting, sharing and seeding we can enjoy these songs together).\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:135be3fe7d3fd602e5e6e3536b93ee5d5b657019","amp;dn":"Dutch+Treat+-+Indie+Playlist+1109+%28Addition+1+MP3+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"135be3fe7d3fd602e5e6e3536b93ee5d5b657019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,91,227,254,125,63,214,2,229,230,227,83,107,147,238,93,91,101,112,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
