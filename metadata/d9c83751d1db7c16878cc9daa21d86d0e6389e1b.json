Meanwhile, Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) continues to annoy everybody, and Scrat the rock rat is still trying to get that acorn. When Sid accidentally discovers an underground world populated by dinosaurs, he steals three dino eggs so that he, too, can become a &quot;mommy.&quot; After the little ones hatch, their real mom comes to retrieve them, and snatches Sid as well, prompting the others to band together yet in order to rescue their friend.\n\nRipped with Autogk\n\nLength: 1 Hour 34 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 640\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 25fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 124kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c83751d1db7c16878cc9daa21d86d0e6389e1b","amp;dn":"Ice+Age%3A+Dawn+of+the+Dinosaurs%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c83751d1db7c16878cc9daa21d86d0e6389e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,200,55,81,209,219,124,22,135,140,201,218,162,29,134,208,230,56,158,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
