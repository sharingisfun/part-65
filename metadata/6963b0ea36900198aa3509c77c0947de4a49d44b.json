Via the included keygen (a windows app unfortunately) the key is generated and you can use Mathematica at full blast, indefinitely.\n\nPlease remember though, if you like it and use it, buy it when you have the funds..\n\n** Note: I'm doing this off my laptop, so if the seed vanishes, use an ultraviolet light. Or, just wait a little while and I'll have it up again within 12hrs **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6963b0ea36900198aa3509c77c0947de4a49d44b","amp;dn":"Mathematica+8.0.4+Linux%2FUNIX+w%2F+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6963b0ea36900198aa3509c77c0947de4a49d44b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,99,176,234,54,144,1,152,170,53,9,199,124,9,71,222,74,73,212,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
