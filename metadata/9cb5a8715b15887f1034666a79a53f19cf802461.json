It should not be confused with the PBS game show Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?.[3] The Earth show was made by DIC/Program Exchange and originally aired Saturday mornings on FOX. Its episodes have subsequently been repeated on the Fox Family, PAX and the short-lived girlzChannel. Reruns of the series currently air on The Worship Network, KidMango, The Hub, and, starting spring 2012, on Qubo. The series won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Animated Children's Program&quot; in 1995.\n\nThe first season of the series is now available on DVD from Shout! Factory. Lions Gate Entertainment has released two of the show's three-part episodes (&quot;Retribution&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;) as full-length direct-to-video films entitled &quot;Carmen's Revenge&quot; &amp; &quot;Time Traveler&quot; respectively. A video of the episode &quot;Timing is Everything&quot; is included with some versions of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Treasures of Knowledge.[4] All 40 episodes of the series were released on a 4- disc DVD set in February 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb5a8715b15887f1034666a79a53f19cf802461","amp;dn":"Where+on+Earth+is+Carmen+Sandiego","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb5a8715b15887f1034666a79a53f19cf802461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,181,168,113,91,21,136,127,16,52,102,106,121,165,63,25,207,128,36,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
