The sole notable exception      \n         is of course Danny DeVito, who received top billing on       \n         home video releases, and is presumably the main reason       \n         this made it to DVD at all - despite his brief bit part      \n         lasting less than 7 minutes!                                 \n                                                                      \n           Lead Stuart Goetz may not have had much of an acting       \n         career, but later went on to rediscover himself as a         \n         music editor, for which he made an industry name for         \n         himself - not only on shows like One Tree Hill, The West     \n         Wing or Everwood, but more importantly, plenty of 80s        \n         Saturday morning cartoons!                                   \n                                                                      \n           What ultimately makes this an interesting title is         \n         beause of the role it played as a 70s early forerunner       \n         to what would become the hugely successful category of       \n         teen sex comedies of the 80s, and for that we feel it is     \n         certainly worth watching.                                    \n                                                                      \n           Enjoy!                                                     \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                 \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab483071bcb79ad04025ba4d2ff0d4ab725f2efa","amp;dn":"The.Van.1977.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab483071bcb79ad04025ba4d2ff0d4ab725f2efa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,72,48,113,188,183,154,208,64,37,186,77,47,240,212,171,114,95,46,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
