This film follows such notorious cult figures as: Blek Le Rat, Nano 4814, Nuria, Sweet Toof, NoNose, and Eine, as they work upon the pavements of Paris Londonand Madrid During the film we pursue these characters as they create new pieces and discuss the varying approaches to Street Art in these three diverse cities.\n\nWe also meet some of the artists taking part in the first ever Street Art exhibition at Tate Modern, and explore the rapidly expanding commercial market that\\'s turning street artists into big earners at the auction houses. What does this newfound profitable aspect mean for this formerly underground and anti-establishment scene?\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1920 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:88\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s VCB\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 22 mins\nPart Size: 350MB\nRipped by: artistharry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca14e2aa96558ca2451dc3b936f4bd2fc7bc0ef9","amp;dn":"Street.Art.Xvid.MP3.MVGroup.Forum.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca14e2aa96558ca2451dc3b936f4bd2fc7bc0ef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,20,226,170,150,85,140,162,69,29,195,185,54,244,189,47,199,188,14,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
