If you want the track listing and stuff, the discogs page is here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Lesser--Kid606-Split/release/33039&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Lesser--Kid606-Split/release/33039&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKid606's half is pretty early material, so if you were at all interested by &quot;Don't Sweat the Technics&quot; (I'm seeding that right now too if you wanted it) then this would be a smart download.\n\nLesser's side is very good as well; this is sort of my first Lesser album, so I don't really know what to compare it to. Just trust me, it's pretty cool.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd7d0c93050732e58ee49b7d982b422ff731098","amp;dn":"Lesser+%2F+Kid606+Split+Compact+Disc+%28rare%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd7d0c93050732e58ee49b7d982b422ff731098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,215,208,201,48,80,115,46,88,238,73,183,217,130,180,34,255,115,16,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
