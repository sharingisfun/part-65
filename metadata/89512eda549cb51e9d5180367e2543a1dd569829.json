Bubba Brady (Patrick Fleuger) is searching for work, but every lead he finds just takes him to another dead end. Then he meets Jim (Perlman), a carefree vagrant touting a golden opportunity with a mysterious, cigar smoking man named Perriman (Pantaliano). The pay is good; unfortunately the job entails murdering a man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been skimming profits from a powerful gangster. With the $200,000 he would earn from taking the job, Bubba could finally give his girlfriend Joy (Manning) the life theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always dreamt about. Now, if Bubba can just switch off his conscience and embrace his inner-killer, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be on the fast track to financial freedom in no time. Of course thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easier said than done, and when the time comes to carry out the job, Bubba ponders the prospect of outsourcing the hit to his old pal Jim, who never let a moral quandary prevent him from collecting a big paycheck. \n\nGenre: Comedy | Drama | Thriller \nIMDB Rating: 5.0/10 from 462 users \nDirected by: Shem Bitterman \nStarring: Patrick John Flueger, Ron Perlman and Taryn Manning \n\nRelease Name: The.Job.2010.BDrip.XVID.AC3-ADTRG \nSize: 1.49GB \nVideo: XviD, 720Ãƒâ€”400, 1798 Kbps, 23.976 fps \nAudio: English, AC3, 384 kbps \nRuntime: 1h 38mn\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89512eda549cb51e9d5180367e2543a1dd569829","amp;dn":"The.Job.2010.BDrip.XVID.AC3-ADTRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89512eda549cb51e9d5180367e2543a1dd569829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,81,46,218,84,156,181,30,157,81,128,54,126,37,67,161,221,86,152,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
