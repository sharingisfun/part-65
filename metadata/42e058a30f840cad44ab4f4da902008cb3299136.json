There is such presence on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;In My Room\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; you actually feel you were in the room when it was recorded. While there are some early Brian Wilson classics, the majority of the music is surf-themed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;filler,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; enjoyable but mere ear candy. This has been a much sought-after MFSL disc and I have seen it going on eBay for up to $300.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42e058a30f840cad44ab4f4da902008cb3299136","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+Surfin%5C%27+U.S.A.+%26amp%3B+Surfer+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42e058a30f840cad44ab4f4da902008cb3299136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,224,88,163,15,132,12,173,68,171,79,77,169,2,0,140,179,41,145,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
