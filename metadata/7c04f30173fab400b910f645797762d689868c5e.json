Yet it is that very contrast that explains the power of these performances: In revisiting its torchy standards, Holiday reduces them to their core of pain and longing, transforming &quot;I'm a Fool to Want You,&quot; &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is,&quot; and &quot;You've Changed&quot; into naked declarations as mesmerizing and unsettling as a horrific accident. Any postrocker that presumes pop standards and string sections automatically translate to &quot;easy listening&quot; hasn't listened to this. This 1997 version adds unreleased takes and a beautiful 20-bit digital transfer to extract every shivering pang of Holiday's music.\n\n[AUDiNT]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c04f30173fab400b910f645797762d689868c5e","amp;dn":"Billie+Holiday+-+Lady+In+Satin+%5BFLAC%5D%5BAUDiNT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c04f30173fab400b910f645797762d689868c5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,4,243,1,115,250,180,0,185,16,246,69,121,119,98,214,137,134,140,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
