This is a 2007 remaster of his 1998 solo album.\n\nLamahl's career started in the early 80s when he joined Kajagoogoo as lead singer. The band hit the &quot;limelight&quot; with the release of &quot;Too Shy&quot;, which became an international chartbuster.  Limahl is perhaps best known, however, for his performance of &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; theme on Giorgio Moroder's original soundtrack album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e07e74a3df19b21a1772d735f09e7993e221d99","amp;dn":"Limahl+-+The+Best+of+Limahl+%282007+Remaster%29+%2B+CD%2Ccovers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e07e74a3df19b21a1772d735f09e7993e221d99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,7,231,74,61,241,155,33,161,119,45,115,95,9,231,153,62,34,29,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
