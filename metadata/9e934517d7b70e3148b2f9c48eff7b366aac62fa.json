They go to a lake, but when Ash forces Oshawott's eyes open while they are swimming, he gets upset and uses Water gun on Ash and blows him out of the lake. At their campsite, Iris is watching over the other PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon while they are playing a game. As Emolga and Snivy get in a fight, Scraggy wanders off and finds a group of Foongus that he angers by using headbutt. The Foongus use Poison Powder that hits all of the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon. Cilan, Ash, and Oshawott go out to find a herb that will cure the poison, but it only grows at the bottom of a lake. Ash takes Oshawott with him into the lake, where they are spotted by a wild Palpitoad, angered because of it's encounter with Trip. The Palpitoad instructs a school of Tympole to attack them, and Oshawott cannot fight back because he cannot see them. He holds his own until he gains enough courage and opens up his eyes, scaring the Tympole off. However, Palpitoad calls upon a Stunfisk friend that uses Discharge to force Ash and Oshawott out of the lake. Cilan decides to use his fishing skills to get the Stunfisk out of the water, drawing Palpitoad out as well. Oshawott battles against Palpitoad while Cilan uses his fishing rod to get Stunfisk KO'd. Oshawott finally is able to defeat Palpitoad when he opens his eyes during Aqua Jet, allowing Ash to capture Palpitoad while Cilan captures Stunfisk. Oshawott dives into the lake once more and finds the herb, which they bring back to camp to heal the others. Oshawoot manages to earn the full respect and gratitude of all the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon. \n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Pokemon Black and White -35- Facing Fear With Eyes Wide Open! 720p salman sk.m4v\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 100 MiB\nDuration                         : 21mn 22s\nOverall bit rate                 : 657 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2011-09-18 12:23:25\nTagged date                      : UTC 2011-09-18 12:42:02\nlanguage\t\t\t : English\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9ad7fbf3f4dad6a9b4ab&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 4 frames\nFormat settings, GOP             : M=1, N=2\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 21mn 22s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 490 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate               : 29.412 fps\nMaximum frame rate               : 30.303 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.018\nStream size                      : 74.9 MiB (75%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 112\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nFormat settings, SBR             : No\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 21mn 21s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 190 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 24.4 MiB (24%)\nLanguage                         : English\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2011-09-18 12:23:25\nTagged date                      : UTC 2011-09-18 12:42:02\nAudio language\t\t\t : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e934517d7b70e3148b2f9c48eff7b366aac62fa","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Black+and+White+-35-+Facing+Fear+With+Eyes+Wide+Open%21+72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e934517d7b70e3148b2f9c48eff7b366aac62fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,147,69,23,215,183,14,49,72,178,249,196,142,255,123,54,106,172,98,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
