Slater is the hero of the Jack Slater film series, a fearless LAPD detective whose commanding officer Lieutenant Dekker (Frank McRae) frequently yells at him for breaking the rules.\n\nSince his father died, Danny has been skipping school to watch movies with his friend Nick, an old man who operates a run-down movie theater in New York City. Nick invites Danny to a private screening of Jack Slater IV and gives him a magic ticket originally given to Nick by Harry Houdini. Before the show, Nick tears the ticket in half, gives one half to Danny, and puts the other in the ticket box. A few minutes into Slater IV, Danny's ticket stub begins to glow, and some dynamite from within the film flies out of the screen, lands near Danny, and explodes. When Danny wakes up, he is in the back seat of Slater's car, being chased through Los Angeles in the world of Slater IV. He tries to convince Slater that they are in a film, but Slater sees nothing unusual about his world, which includes a cartoon cat detective named Whiskers (Danny DeVito), a black-and-white image of Humphrey Bogart, female officers dressed in outlandish battle armor, and various characters from other Schwarzenegger films.\n\nAs Slater and Danny drive along the coast, Danny recognizes the mansion from Slater IV's introduction and persuades Slater to investigate it. Despite Slater's skepticism, they meet the villains, crime boss Tony Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn) and his British henchman Mr. Benedict (Dance). After overhearing Danny discussing his role in the Slater film, Benedict follows Slater and Danny as they visit Slater's daughter, Whitney (Bridgette Wilson), raids the house with some thugs, takes the magic ticket from Danny, and escapes after a gun battle with Slater and Whitney. While inspecting the ticket at the mansion, he discovers a portal to the real world.\n\nEventually, Slater and Danny figure out that Vivaldi plans to kill his rivals at a rooftop funeral by planting nerve gas in the body. After a brief scene in which Whiskers saves Slater and Danny from betrayal by Slater's friend, Slater tells Danny to commandeer a construction crane, takes the body and escapes from the funeral, and disposes of the body with Danny's help at the crane. Whitney arrives in her truck immediately afterward, and Slater and Danny use the truck to crash into the villains' mansion shortly after Benedict kills Vivaldi. In the ensuing struggle, Benedict and his butler fall through a portal into the real world, and Slater and Danny follow them. In the real New York City, Slater is disappointed to learn that he is a fictional character and resentful at having been given such a hard life by his film's writers. While talking with Danny's mother, he learns to be sensitive and loses interest in violent action.\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\nBig Gun - AC/DC\nAngry Again - Megadeth\nTwo Steps Behind - Def Leppard\nDream On - Aerosmith\nReal World - Queensryche\nWhat The Hell Have I - Alice In Chains\nA Little Bitter - Alice In Chains\nPoison My Eyes - Anthrax\nCock The Hammer - Cypress Hill\nSwim - Fishbone\nLast Action Hero - Tesla\nJach The Ripper - Michael Kamen\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Last.Action.Hero.720p.x264-ITA-ENG.mkv\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 4.43 GiB\nDuration : 2h 5mn\nOverall bit rate : 5 052 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2011-07-08 12:40:12\nWriting application : mkvmerge v4.3.0 ('Escape from the Island') built on Sep 5 2010 10:30:51\nWriting library : libebml v1.0.0 + libmatroska v1.0.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e4ac8d838ca4a8d1cad5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 8 frames\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 2h 5mn\nBit rate : 4 630 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 528 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.40:1\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.274\nStream size : 3.95 GiB (89%)\nWriting library : x264 core 56 svn-680\n\n\nAudio #1\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nFormat profile : Dolby Digital\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 2h 5mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nVideo delay : 12ms\nStream size : 230 MiB (5%)\nLanguage : Italian\n\nAudio #2\nID : 3\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 2h 5mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nVideo delay : 12ms\nStream size : 172 MiB (4%)\nLanguage : English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82839fb03172c38ccf2acdbc84a095af892ff7f9","amp;dn":"Last+action+hero+%5BBDrip+720p+ITA+ENG%5D+1993+%5Bnautilus-bt.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82839fb03172c38ccf2acdbc84a095af892ff7f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,131,159,176,49,114,195,140,207,42,205,188,132,160,149,175,137,47,247,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
