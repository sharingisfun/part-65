With PJ occupied with a &quot;girlfriend,&quot; Wayne is forced to stand guard all night. Meanwhile, Maggie and Nick arrest &quot;Blackjack&quot; Eagan, an ex-copper and hero of PJ's. It turns out Eagan is hanging round Mt. Thomas to avoid some crims he had put away who are due to be released. Tom asks Nick to drop the charges so that Eagan will move on.\nThe next day at the home of a client, Roz sees a pair of earrings which she thinks could be a match for a pair stolen during another burglary Ã¢â‚¬â€ it doesn't help that the client's husband is an ex-crim.
