During his travels, he crosses paths with Fouad Saleh - played by British-Sudanese actor Alexander Siddig - a solitary and amnesic man. Saleh disappeared from Beirut 17 years ago and never returned. Intrigued, KorÃƒÂ© tries to discover the history of this man, and the experience changes him forever. The history and especially the character of Thomas KorÃƒÂ© is strongly inspired by the photographic wanderings of Antoine d'Agata, the set consultant for Danielle Arbid.\n\n\nLanguages: French / English / Arabic\n\nSubtitles srt: English / Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcce10774928cceb065bd91469eab10ffe2bcd5e","amp;dn":"Un+Homme+Perdu+aka+A+Lost+Man+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcce10774928cceb065bd91469eab10ffe2bcd5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,206,16,119,73,40,204,235,6,91,217,20,105,234,177,15,254,43,205,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
