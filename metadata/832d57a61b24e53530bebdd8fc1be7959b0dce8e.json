In the prologue of the film, he briefly sketches out his life in a monotone voiceover: growing up without parents, receiving an &quot;education&quot; from his criminal uncle, initial protection money rackets in the wake of privatizations in the crumbling Soviet Union, later international drug dealing. His enemies are numerous but not easy to recognize; &quot;life is short, the greater part of it already over&quot;. Although there is only a small chance that Gena will be able to trade in his nomadic existence between Asia and Europe for a &quot;normal life&quot;, he takes the plunge anyway. A frantic chase across Europe thus ensues. Heading west, presumably towards the sun.\n\nSharunas Bartas paints a dark picture of a globalized world where values seem to have disappeared along with the sunlight. A wintry Europe, where each place is as inhospitable as the next. A gangster wanting to leave the business, joining his famous spiritual brothers Jeff Bailey, Frankie Bono and Jegor Prokudin in most memorable fashion. A 21st century film noir, in which the underworld knows no code of honor and compassion will be avenged. Fatally.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nComplete name : Indigene d'Eurasie.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 1.46 GiB\nDuration : 1h 47mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 952 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3 | www.virtualdub-fr.org || (build 2550/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2550/release\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 2\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 47mn\nBit rate : 1 495 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.875\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.216\nStream size : 1.12 GiB (77%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 47mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 343 MiB (23%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:832d57a61b24e53530bebdd8fc1be7959b0dce8e","amp;dn":"Indig%26egrave%3Bne+d%27Eurasie+%28Sharunas+Bartas%2C+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"832d57a61b24e53530bebdd8fc1be7959b0dce8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,45,87,166,27,36,229,53,48,190,189,216,252,27,231,149,155,13,206,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
