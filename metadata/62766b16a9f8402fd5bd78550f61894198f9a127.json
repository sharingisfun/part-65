The song was written by Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd\\'s co-founder and original front man. Although not originally included on the band\\'s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, \\&quot;Arnold Layne\\&quot; is featured on numerous compilation albums of the band.The song\\'s title character is a transvestite whose primary pastime is stealing women\\'s clothes and undergarments from washing lines. According to Roger Waters, \\&quot;Arnold Layne\\&quot; was actually based on a real person. Despite finding a place in the Top 20, the song\\'s unusual transvestism theme attracted the ire of Radio London, which deemed the song was too far-removed from \\&quot;normal\\&quot; society for its listeners, before eventually banning it from radio airplay altogether. A black and white promotional film of \\&quot;Arnold Layne\\&quot; was made the same year, and featured members of Pink Floyd dressing up a mannequin before showing it around a beach in East Wittering, West Sussex.\n     \\&quot;The Scarecrow\\&quot; is a song on Pink Floyd\\'s debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967),though it first appeared as the B-side of their second single \\&quot;See Emily Play\\&quot; (as \\&quot;Scarecrow\\&quot;) two months before. It was written by original frontman Syd Barrett and recorded in March 1967. The song contains nascent existentialist themes, as singer Syd Barrett compares his own existence to that of the scarecrow, who, while \\&quot;sadder\\&quot; is also \\&quot;resigned to his fate\\&quot;. Such thematic content would later become a mainstay of the band\\'s lyrical imagery.   \n    \\&quot;Morning Dew\\&quot;, also known as \\&quot;(Walk Me Out in the) Morning Dew\\&quot;, is a post-apocalyptic folk-rock song written by Canadian singer Bonnie Dobson in 1962. Fred Neil (American folk singer-songwriter)  heard Dobson\\'s song and re-arranged it to suit his own style. Tim Rose heard Neil\\'s version and then recorded his own in 1966, adding himself as co-writer. Through a loophole in US copyright law, Rose was able to claim royalties. Dobson has consistently questioned Rose\\'s right to a co-writing credit.\n     Episode Six recorded a cover version  of the song and released as single in June 9, 1967. This is possibly the earliest footage to feature the future Deep Purple front man Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover.\n\n\n        Episode Six was a British vocal pop-rock group during the mid 1960s. The band was not well known, but foreshadowed the arrival of Deep Purple in late 1960s. In 1967, they began to fuse pop and psychedelia with reasonably impressive results, especially the single \\&quot;I Can See Through You\\&quot; (written by Glover), one of the finest British psychedelic obscurities. Their final two singles showed the band going in a much more progressive direction and anticipating some of the most indulgent art rock of the \\'70s with \\&quot;Mozart Versus the Rest,\\&quot; which assaulted one of the composer\\'s most famous riffs with manic electric guitars. Episode Six folded in 1969, after Gillan and Glover had joined Deep Purple. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 HISTORY OF POP AND ROCK MUSIC \n                  The Roots of Rock \\'n\\' Roll:  \n\n\n\n     07.05.00.  PSYCHODELIC POP AND ROCK \n\n     Psychedelic rock evolved in the 60s as an offshoot of the rock and roll movement combining elements of pop,rock, electronic music, eastern influences - particularly sitars, and other diverse elements. Inspired by the use of mind altering drugs like cannabis, mescaline, psilocybin, and especially LSD, psychedelic rock broke with traditional rock and laid the roots for Krautrock and experimental rock genres of the seventies and eighties. Psychedelic music could be interpreted as simply a \\&quot;surreal and dreamy feeling\\&quot; in a particular song, instead of a specific genre with rules to follow. In some cases, this simply requires writing one coherent song, then to experiment recording that song in the studio while under \\&quot;psychedelic influence\\&quot;, yielding very surreal musical results.\n    Psychedelic pop is a musical style inspired by the harder, louder songs of psychedelic rock but applied more to a pop music setting.\n          \n\n\n         PINK FLOYD  -  Arnold Layne  (1967) \n         PINK FLOYD  -  The Scarecrow  (1967)\n         PINK FLOYD   -  See  Emily  Play   (1967)\n         EPISODE SIX  -  Morning Dew  (1967)\n         EPISODE SIX  -  I hear Trumpets Blow   (1967)\n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ White Rabbit   ( 1967)\n         THE BEATLES  -  I AM THE WALRUS  (1967)\n         THE BEATLES  - BLUE JAY WAY  (1967)\n         TRAFFIC - HOLE IN MY SHOE   (1967)\n         THE ROLLING STONES - WE LOVE YOU  (1967)\n         THE ROLLING STONES -  2000 LIGHT YEARS FROM HOME  (1967)\n         PINK FLOYD   -  INTERSTELLAR OVERDRIVE  (1967)\n         THE DOORS - THE CRYSTAL SHIP   (1967)\n         TRAFFIC  -  PAPER SUN  (1967)\n         JANIS JOPLIN  -  BALL AND CHAIN  (1967)\n         STATUS QUO  -  PICTURES OF MATCHSTICK MEN  (1968)\n         PINK FLOYD  -  SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN  (1968)\n         PINK FLOYD  -  CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE, EUGENE  (1968)\n         JIMI HENDRIX  -  ARE YOU EXPERIENCED   (Promo)  \n         JIMI HENDRIX  -  VOODOO CHILD  (Psychedelic Promo)\n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE - CROWN OF CREATION (1968)\n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE  - WE CAN BE TOGETHER (1969) - Altamont \n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE  - THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS LIFE (1969) - Altamont \n         THE GRATEFUL DEAD  -  HARD TO HANDLE  (1970)\n         THE GRATEFUL DEAD  -  CHINA CAT  SUNFLOWER  ( I Know You Rider) (1970)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62766b16a9f8402fd5bd78550f61894198f9a127","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+307","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62766b16a9f8402fd5bd78550f61894198f9a127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,118,107,22,169,248,64,47,213,189,120,85,15,97,137,65,152,249,161,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
