As frontman for the Pogues, Shane MacGowan always managed to combine the two into one gloriously drunken whole. In the years between 1983 and 1991, the Pogues--their name derived from the Gaelic for &quot;kiss my arse&quot;--released five albums marrying the melodies of traditional Irish folk to the energy of punk-rock and rockabilly. It's the tracks on The Very Best Of, drawn from The Pogues' two most celebrated albums--Rum, Sodomy and the Lash and If I Should Fall from Grace with God--that find the band on top form; see the drunken Yuletime feud of &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; featuring the late Kirsty MacColl, or the violent pint-downer of &quot;The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn&quot;. A look beyond the drinking songs, however, and it may come as a surprise to many that MacGowan's lyrics touch on The Big Themes--romance, misery, pride and self-destruction--with a rare eloquence; the raw emotions played out in the likes of &quot;The Old Main Drag&quot;--a bare, honest tale of poverty and addiction, the young MacGowan &quot;spat on and shat on and raped and abused&quot;--are a reminder that the Pogues may have been seldom sober, but they were never anything less than utterly human. --Louis Pattison\n\n&quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; (Shane MacGowan, Jem Finer)\n&quot;Sally MacLennane&quot; (MacGowan)\n&quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; (Ewan MacColl)\n&quot;The Irish Rover&quot; (Traditional, arr.
