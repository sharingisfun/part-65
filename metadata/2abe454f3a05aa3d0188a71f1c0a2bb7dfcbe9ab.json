What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 4- Thursday - We say goodbye to another contestant after a hard fought poultry elimination challenge. They must name that bird then cook that bird. Quail, duck, chicken and turkey are served up. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2abe454f3a05aa3d0188a71f1c0a2bb7dfcbe9ab","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E23.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2abe454f3a05aa3d0188a71f1c0a2bb7dfcbe9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,190,69,79,58,5,170,61,1,136,167,31,28,10,43,183,223,203,233,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
