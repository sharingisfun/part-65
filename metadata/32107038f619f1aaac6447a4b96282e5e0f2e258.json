It was released on July 19, 2011 in the US and in the UK. This is Cold's first album since their reunion and six years since their previous release. There have been two singles from the album so far, including &quot;Wicked World&quot; and &quot;American Dream&quot;. While touring the band announced that at every show they would be recording their new song &quot;Snowblind&quot; and that the best performance would be included as a hidden track on the new album, this however turned out to be untrue as the retail versions only contain the original twelve songs proposed for the release.\n\nOn Superfiction, Cold combines vivid, vibrant storytelling with elegantly heavy hard rock. It's a combination that the band has perfected since they burst onto the scene in 2003 with Year of the Spider, which went to #3 on The Billboard 200 chart and spurred the hit &quot;Stupid Girl.&quot; Cold preserve the alluring darkness that made them a rock mainstay, while honing their approach into an intricate, introspective, and inspirational style.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Wicked World\n2. What Happens Now\n3. American Dream\n4. The Break\n5. Welcome2MyWorld\n6. Emily\n7. The Crossroads\n8. Delivering The Saint\n9. So Long June\n10. The Park\n11. Flight Of The Superstar\n12. The Ballad Of The Nameless\n\nENJOY!\n\nCross posted from Demonoid : Uploader - Megzamani","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32107038f619f1aaac6447a4b96282e5e0f2e258","amp;dn":"Cold+-+Superfiction+%28EAC%2FFLAC%2FLOG%2FCUE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32107038f619f1aaac6447a4b96282e5e0f2e258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,16,112,56,246,25,241,170,172,100,71,164,185,98,130,229,224,242,226,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
