Not only does it cover the entire Mac platform including reviews, tutorials and features but also has a dedicated mini-magazine called iPlay, where you can get incredible content covering everything iPad, iPod and iPhone. iCreate is sumptuously designed and it not only keeps you informed of whats going on in the world of Apple, but it is also there to help you get the most out of whichever device you own. Tutorials cover the entire iLife suite and professional applications as well as helping you make the most of your mobile Apple devices too, whether thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an iPod touch, iPad or iPhone. If Apple made a magazine - it would be iCreate.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c90721a6e4a660734ef7ed8794a3440a82f56874","amp;dn":"+iCreate++-+Issue+109%2C+2012+%28.PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c90721a6e4a660734ef7ed8794a3440a82f56874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,7,33,166,228,166,96,115,78,247,237,135,148,163,68,10,130,245,104,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
