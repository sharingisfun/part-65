ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was really great to have that many songs,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Guthrie, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbut at the same time, what do you do with the rest? They werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t any less good. We just picked the songs that we thought went together well.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBright Examples was co-produced by Andy Cabic, the prime mover behind the San Francisco pastoral psych-rock band Vetiver, and Thom Monahan, who has also worked with Vetiver as well as Devendra Banhart, the Pernice Brothers and Jayhawks vocalist Gary Louris, who just happened to have produced Exploration for Sarah Lee and Johnny.
