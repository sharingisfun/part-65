What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 7 - Friday - Gary and Matt Moran head up a MasterClass of French onion soup, roast chicken and yummy pork belly with noodles. Later we learn the art of baking classic cakes with chef Philippe Mouchel. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:464e3c27c6019339c2c9deb83fb32476c9116814","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E42.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"464e3c27c6019339c2c9deb83fb32476c9116814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,78,60,39,198,1,147,57,194,201,222,184,63,179,36,118,201,17,104,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
