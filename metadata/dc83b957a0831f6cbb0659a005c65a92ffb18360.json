Her mother tries to get her a job in the office of a lawyer, Bleistein, her lover years ago. Jeanne fails the interview but falls into a relationship with Franck, a wrestler whose dreams and claims of being in a legitimate business partnership Jeanne is only too happy to believe. When Franck is arrested, he turns on Jeanne for her naivety; she's stung and seeks attention by making up a story of an attack on a train. Is there any way out for her? In a subplot, Bleistein's grandson, Nathan, prepares for his bar mitzvah and, through an encounter with Jeanne, experiences intimations of manhood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc83b957a0831f6cbb0659a005c65a92ffb18360","amp;dn":"La+Fille+du+RER+aka+The+Girl+on+the+Train+2009+DVDRip+Sonata+Pre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc83b957a0831f6cbb0659a005c65a92ffb18360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,131,185,87,160,131,31,108,187,6,89,160,5,198,90,146,255,177,131,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
