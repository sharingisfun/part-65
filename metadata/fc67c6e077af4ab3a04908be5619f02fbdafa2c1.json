The innovative acoustic hail from the northwest of England are bound together not only by musical roots - but also red hair! The line-up comprises the distinctive, captivating vocals of a new face on the scene, Lucy Wright, who is also a fine JewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ harp player. Lucy has joined forces with fiddler Tom Kitching, a former BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Awards finalist. Probably best known as one half of a duo with singer-songwriter/guitarist Gren Bartley, Tom has been described by Living Tradition magazine as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of the best young fiddlers in BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and also plays a mean mandolin. The third ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpilgrimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is inventive box player Edwin Beasant -an incorrigible and talented multi-instrumentalist, who also plays guitar and bass and had a stint as drummer. Focusing on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgimmick free folkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and drawing inspiration from some of the most influential bands of the 60s and 70s revival, the resulting sound is edgier than the folk on the village green but firmly rooted in the traditions of England and its cross-currents with Ireland and America.This is their debut album.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/04/pilgrims%e2%80%99-way/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/04/pilgrims%e2%80%99-way/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc67c6e077af4ab3a04908be5619f02fbdafa2c1","amp;dn":"Pilgrims%5C%27+Way...Wayside+Courtesies%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc67c6e077af4ab3a04908be5619f02fbdafa2c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,103,198,224,119,175,74,179,160,73,8,190,86,25,240,47,189,175,162,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
