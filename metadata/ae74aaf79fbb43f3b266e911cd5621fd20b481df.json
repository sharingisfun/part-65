I had ear pain after he hit me, so I sued. But a doctor told me that I had a &quot;jurosomatic&quot; illness - I held onto pain because I was involved in a lawsuit. Is that possible?\n\nI'll ask Senator John Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon.\n\nOur other guests will explain how some attorneys exploit our legal system.\n\nBob Dorigo Jones holds an annual contest to determine the dumbest warning labels, like the one on an electric razor that says, &quot;Never use while sleeping.&quot;\n\nDrew Curtis, founder of the popular news website FARK.com, will tell us how patent trolls stifle innovation. Curtis was sued.\n\nSome workers lie about injuries to collect disability payments, but were caught on video by Paul Colbert. He uses undercover cameras to prove fraud.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae74aaf79fbb43f3b266e911cd5621fd20b481df","amp;dn":"20120614-Stossel-%5BLawsuit+Abuse%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae74aaf79fbb43f3b266e911cd5621fd20b481df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,116,170,247,159,187,67,243,178,102,233,17,205,86,33,253,32,180,129,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
