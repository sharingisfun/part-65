It was created and written by Toby Whithouse and is currently broadcast on BBC Three.[1] The show blends elements of flatshare comedy and horror drama. It originally starred Aidan Turner as Mitchell (a vampire), Russell Tovey as George (a werewolf) and Lenora Crichlow as Annie (a ghost)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all of whom are sharing accommodation and attempting as best as they can to live a &quot;normal&quot; life and blend in with the ordinary humans around them. During the show's second series, Sinead Keenan became part of the main cast. The first two series were set in in Totterdown, Bristol, and the third series relocated to Barry, Wales.[2][3] On 13 March 2011, series creator Toby Whithouse announced that Turner had left the show and that new characters would be introduced.[4]\n\nThe series is one of the most popular shows on BBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s iPlayer.[5][6][7] The second series premiered on BBC Three on 10 January 2010.[8] The third series premiered on 23 January 2011. The day following the series 3 finale, the BBC announced a fourth series would premiere on the BBC in 2012.[9]\n\n\n\nSeries 3 saw the protagonists move to Barry Island in South Wales (as the result of events in Series 2).

As Series 3 progresses, the quartet must deal with the return of various figures and events from George and Mitchell's past, more supernatural incursions (more vampires including a teenager and a pair of suburban swingers, a zombie WAG and a pair of werewolves who have set themselves up as vampire hunters) and the complications of their own developing relationships. Events lead up to a finale which leaves the household changed dramatically.
