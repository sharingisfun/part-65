It was recorded in 1974 in Macon, Georgia at Capricorn Studios. On this album, Betts further develops and perfects the country sound that emerged on the Allman's 1973 album Brothers and Sisters. The standout tracks are &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;, &quot;Highway Call&quot;, and the extended country jam &quot;Hand Picked&quot;. Guest musicians include Vassar Clements on fiddle and Jeff Hanna on acoustic guitar.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n   1. &quot;Long Time Gone&quot; (Betts) - 4:31\n   2. &quot;Rain&quot; (Betts) - 3:40\n   3. &quot;Highway Call&quot; (Betts) - 4:26\n   4. &quot;Let Nature Sing&quot; (Betts) - 5:10\n   5. &quot;Hand Picked&quot; (Betts) - 14:20\n   6. &quot;Kissimmee Kid&quot; (Vassar Clements) - 3:13\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Dickey Betts - electric guitar, acoustic guitar, dobro, lead vocals\n    * Vassar Clements - fiddle\n    * Chuck Leavell - piano\n    * Tommy Talton - acoustic guitar\n    * John Hughey - steel guitar\n    * Walter Poindexter - banjo, background vocals\n    * Leon Poindexter - acoustic guitar, background vocals\n    * Frank Poindexter - dobro, background vocals\n    * Stray Straton - bass, background vocals\n    * Johnny Sandlin - bass\n    * Oscar Underwood Adams - mandolin\n    * David Walshaw - drums, percussion\n    * Reese Wynans - harmonica\n    * The Rambos (Buck, Dottie, and Reba) - background vocals\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a9bd4d0b238c7c6af568feec92b3747a7e557bd","amp;dn":"Richard+Betts+-+Highway+Call+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a9bd4d0b238c7c6af568feec92b3747a7e557bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,155,212,208,178,56,199,198,175,86,143,238,201,43,55,71,167,229,87,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
