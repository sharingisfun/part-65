Petrilli\n\nTrained in the Philippines by Filipino legend Grandmaster Ciriaco \\&quot;Cacoy\\&quot; Canete himself, 8th degree black belt Christopher Petrilli has distilled his knowledge of Japanese aikido, Indonesian silat and Filipino Doce Pares eskrima into an elevated system of stick fighting that goes far beyond anything previously captured on video.\n\nVolume 3 wraps up with several more locking and throwing lines, going from over the arm to under it. Finally, he takes the stick away, teaching you how to do the same techniques empty-handed to the same brutal effect. For information purposes only.\n\nShow someone you love them, hit\\'em with a stick! \n\nKeywords: silat, escrima, kali, knife fighting, self defense, martial art, stick fighting,cane\n\nFor other stick/FMA type stuff:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/norrish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/norrish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e60bfe280b458dca9ad65d40bdc28578b054cf","amp;dn":"Crashing+the+Lines+3+of+3+-+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e60bfe280b458dca9ad65d40bdc28578b054cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,230,11,254,40,11,69,141,202,154,214,93,64,189,194,133,120,176,84,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
