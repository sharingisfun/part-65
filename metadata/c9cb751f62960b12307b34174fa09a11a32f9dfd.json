Their albums are now very rare. Justo A Mi Gusto is a rewrite of Paul Revere and The Raiders' Just Like Me. It can also be heard on Sons Of YMA compilation, along with Solo Estoy, one of their single tracks. Both are well worth hearing - they were among Peru's finest bands.\nThe Los Yorks' 68 album cover bears a striking resemblance to that of Love's Forever Changes album.\nOther compilation coverage has included Mi Mente En Ti on Seeds Turn To Flowers Turn To Dust (CD) and Vallery on Los Demonios Del Rock, which has some pleasing guitar moments in places.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Pronto Un Doctor\n02. Vete Al Infierno\n03. Rogaras\n04. La Carta\n05. Esperando\n06. Enamorada De Un Amigo Mio\n07. Abrasame\n08. No Puedo Amar\n09. Cielo (Sunny)\n10. Muy Facil\n11. Hunki Panky\n12. Pensando Estoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9cb751f62960b12307b34174fa09a11a32f9dfd","amp;dn":"Los+Yorks+-+Los+Yorks%27+67+%281967+Peru%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9cb751f62960b12307b34174fa09a11a32f9dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,203,117,31,98,150,11,18,48,123,52,23,79,160,154,17,163,47,157,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
