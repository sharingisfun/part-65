Mr. Pye is a       \n         man on a mission, or as he might describe it, an             \n         evangelical adventure. He has come to encourage the          \n         residents to put aside their differences and embrace his     \n         concept of The Great Pal. This proves harder than he         \n         expected as Sark has bred a good many long-standing          \n         disagreements and rubbed-the-wrong-way rivalries.            \n         There's his landlady, the formidable Miss Dredger, and       \n         her ongoing feud with the equally formidable Miss            \n         George; Thorpe, a frustrated artist in more ways than        \n         one, especially by his love for the free-loving Tanty;       \n         and then there s Mr. Pye himself, a man about to             \n         discover how demanding the Great Pal can be, as first he     \n         pays the price for being too good... and then for being      \n         too evil.                                                    \n                                                                      \n           Part 1:                                                    \n           Mr. Pye arrives and gradually charms his landlady into     \n         becoming an ally. Together they plan a beach barbecue        \n         that is also to involve the cantankerous Miss George -       \n         in a totally unexpected way.                                 \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               RIP NOTES                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Mervyn Peake is probably better known for his many         \n         illustrations, as well as his Gormenghast trilogy, than      \n         he is for writing Mr. Pye. Nevertheless it is a              \n         fascinating story, and a very interesting Christian          \n         allegory. Published in 1953, he personally adapted it        \n         for radio only four years later, but it would be another     \n         three decades, and almost 20 years after his tragic          \n         early death in a mental institution, until it was            \n         adapted for TV.                                              \n                                                                      \n           Mr. Pye is notable for a number of reasons, not least      \n         of which actually being shot in the magical Channel          \n         Island of Sark, where the story takes place. Sark is not     \n         a common place to film, to say the least, and is             \n         commonly referred to as a place where time has stood         \n         still. To this day, motorized vehicles are not allowed       \n         on the island at all (with the exception of tractors),       \n         which, needless to say, alone lead to a number of            \n         interesting challenges.                                      \n                                                                      \n           Tribulations aside, the result is a series that works      \n         just as well today as it did when it first aired 25          \n         years ago. It's a timeless story from a timeless place,      \n         and Derek Jacobi's interpretation of the troubled former     \n         banker is worthy of praise.                                  \n                                                                      \n           Mr. Pye has yet to be released on any format, and has      \n         been rerun only once since its original airing.              \n         Unfortunately we were unable to obtain a copy of the         \n         more recent airing, so this comes from a tape of the         \n         original 1986 broadcast. It's clearly showing its age,       \n         but we've touched it up as best we can.                      \n                                                                      \n           Enjoy!                                                     \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                 \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932137cf0ef57f57d28629b732f28b36f675d6ea","amp;dn":"Mr.Pye.Part.1.1986.TV.VHSRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932137cf0ef57f57d28629b732f28b36f675d6ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,33,55,207,14,245,127,87,210,134,41,183,50,242,139,54,246,117,214,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
