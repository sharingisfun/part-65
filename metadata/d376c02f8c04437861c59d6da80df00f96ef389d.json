The guide is divided into two big parts: the encyclopedia and the walkthrough. In encyclopedia you will find detailed information which help you to achieve 100% in game stats. The walkthrough is just a walkthrough. :) As always, I insist on using the guide only when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in big trouble Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the game is not too hard and the only thing that may cause more trouble is finding all the details and solving some more difficult riddles. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d376c02f8c04437861c59d6da80df00f96ef389d","amp;dn":"Harry+and+order+of+phoenix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d376c02f8c04437861c59d6da80df00f96ef389d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,118,192,47,140,4,67,120,97,197,157,109,168,13,240,15,150,239,56,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
