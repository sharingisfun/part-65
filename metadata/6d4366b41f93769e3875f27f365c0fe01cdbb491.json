As this is my first attempt at uploading a torrent, please show mercy. :)\n\nMy preferred container for movies is mkv. As such, any movie I download that isn't already an mkv, I make it so.\n\n\nI downloaded honda93's &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; a couple of days ago, which has an Info Hash of 329C6874A523F3B63E02364AF9A7A367613E7FC4. The &quot;no sound&quot; comment by f0ofigher21 dated 2008-11-12 17:53 CET may have been correct at the time it was posted. But when I played the whole Video TS folder using VLC 2.0.1, I found no problem with sound.\n\nThen I used mkvtoolnix to convert the VTS_01*.VOB to an mkv. I immediately noticed some problem with the sound but didn't give up.\n\nI noticed that when I asked mkvtoolnix to start with VTS_01_1.VOB, it started with the trailer.\n\nTo get it just right, I had to tell mkvtoolnix to start with VTS_01_0.VOB instead of the usual VTS_01_1.VOB. And I had to delay the audio by a whopping 137,000 milliseconds. Then I told it to split at 00:07:13.\n\nThe resulting mkv seems pretty good.\n\n\n$ mkvinfo What Ever Happened To Baby Jane - 1962.mkv \n+ EBML head\n|+ EBML version: 1\n|+ EBML read version: 1\n|+ EBML maximum ID length: 4\n|+ EBML maximum size length: 8\n|+ Doc type: matroska\n|+ Doc type version: 2\n|+ Doc type read version: 2\n+ Segment, size 3614333922\n|+ Seek head (subentries will be skipped)\n|+ EbmlVoid (size: 4044)\n|+ Segment information\n| + Timecode scale: 1000000\n| + Muxing application: libebml v1.2.2 + libmatroska v1.3.0\n| + Writing application: mkvmerge v5.3.0 ('I could have danced') built on Feb 11 2012 16:21:29\n| + Duration: 7694.104s (02:08:14.104)\n| + Date: Mon Apr 23 14:06:47 2012 UTC\n| + Segment UID: 0xfe 0xbc 0x7d 0x87 0x3d 0x53 0x4e 0x28 0xf8 0x35 0x28 0x1a 0x8e 0x82 0xbb 0xaf \n|+ Segment tracks\n| + A track\n|  + Track number: 1\n|  + Track UID: 1532684169\n|  + Track type: video\n|  + Lacing flag: 0\n|  + MinCache: 2\n|  + Codec ID: V_MPEG2\n|  + Default duration: 40.000ms (25.000 fps for a video track)\n|  + Language: und\n|  + Video track\n|   + Pixel width: 720\n|   + Pixel height: 576\n|   + Display width: 1024\n|   + Display height: 576\n|  + CodecPrivate, length 34\n| + A track\n|  + Track number: 2\n|  + Track UID: 439514688\n|  + Track type: audio\n|  + Codec ID: A_AC3\n|  + Default duration: 32.000ms (31.250 fps for a video track)\n|  + Language: und\n|  + Audio track\n|   + Sampling frequency: 48000\n|   + Channels: 2\n|  + Content encodings\n|   + Content encoding\n|    + Content compression\n|     + Algorithm: 3 (header removal)\n|     + Settings: length 2, data: 0x0b 0x77\n|+ EbmlVoid (size: 1097)\n|+ Cluster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4366b41f93769e3875f27f365c0fe01cdbb491","amp;dn":"What.Ever.Happened.To.Baby+Jane.720p.ac3.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4366b41f93769e3875f27f365c0fe01cdbb491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,67,102,180,31,147,118,158,56,117,242,127,54,92,15,224,28,219,180,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
