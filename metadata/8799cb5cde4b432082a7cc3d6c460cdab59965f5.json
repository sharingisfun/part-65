I will add in the new pictures now, then go through with a sweep of the archive itself for 2.1 which should also be released by the end of this month/next month.\n\nName: ---------------- Gary Oak !Archivex5.\nEmail: --------------- &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;296e485b506648427d5b40594f484e694e44484045074a4644&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; (Yes I DO actually check this!)\nUpdates: ------------- http://rs.4chan.org/?s=Gary+Oak&amp;from=ALL\n\n---\nDisclaimer\n\nI, Gary Oak !Archivex5., am not responsible for the actions of Anonymous with this archive of pokeporn. If you wish to have a picture, flash animation, movie, or work of fiction removed, please\nfuck off kindly.\n\n---\nIntroduction\n\nThe main reason I made this was to combat porn threads by giving those who want to fap, a whole collection of porn that would normally be on /vp/. I don\\'t care how you use it, hell, post it on /vp/. But it\\'s probably a better idea to just fap to yourself anyways. Please share the /rs/ link in porn threads, optionally sage and report.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;/rs/Gary+Oak\n\n                                         SHARING IS CARING!\n\n---\nFAQ\n\nQ: Why is there no M+M gay?\nA: It\\'s in a different part of the Archive. Check here http://rs.4chan.org/?s=Gary+Oak\n\nQ: Something is in the wrong place!\nA: Don\\'t panic, drop an email and I\\'ll get it fixed right away. Simply send the name of the file in the email, and I\\'ll take care of it.\n\nQ: Why is there so much shit in this?\nA: I\\'m too lazy to do a sweep this time. Maybe the next version will be fixed somewhat.\n\nQ: Why is there a lot of X pokemon/character compared to Y pokemon/character?\nA: Some pokemon/characters just don\\'t have that much porn. Sorry bro.\n\nQ: Why is there Digimon in the Archive?\nA: It\\'s a joke.\n\nQ: Can I have some of your real contact info?\nA: No. I check my emails often. Use that.\n\nQ: What\\'s your waifu?\nA: Blaziken. Hnngh.\n\nQ: Gary? Posting porn?\nA: Yes, it\\'s called irony.\n\nQ: What can I do to help?\nA: A thank you and a .7z of all of your pokeporn onwould be nice.\n\n---\nUseful Tools\n\n7-Zip: Better than WinRAR/zip and FREE!\nLink: http://www.7-zip.org/\n\nuTorrent: Piracy ahoy! Also, a neat tool for fast legit downloads too! I recommend the v2.X, though v3.0 works fine too.\nLink: http://www.utorrent.com/\n\n4chanX: A nifty CSS script that adds a lot of user options on 4chan such as refresh, backlinks and quick posting. It requires greasemonkey on Firefox/Nightly, and Chrome/ium users can install it right away.\nLink: http://aeosynth.github.com/4chan-x/\n\nGarynator: The program I used to sort most of the archive. It\\'s many times faster than sorting manually and saved hours of labor. Full keyboard support, and a navigation mode for easy viewing. Still in a beta, but it\\'s still quite workable. Courtesy of wat. For the Archive, it is in navigation mode by default. DDL users can find it as a DDL .7z on the /rs/ page.\n\nYou can find the program and Readme in the Garynator folder, or for torrent users, in the root folder for the archive.\n&gt;Java\n&gt;2011\n\n---\nChangelog\n\n- v2.0 and below.\nCan be viewed in older versions.\n\n- v2.1\nPossible: Added maybe 10-30 pictures. Nobody sends me anything.\nTotal size: 324MB\n\n- v2.2\nPossible: Individual folders for certain pokemon/boys\nTotal size: Unknown\n\n---\nCredits and Thanks\n\n- Every artist that has created everything in here. Without you guys, there\\'d be nothing in the first place!\n- wat, for making the Garynator program, sorting so much porn, and being a cool guy.\n- Keith, qnqnx, Kris, Trainer With a Mouth, Sofa, Kirk, Reginald, wat, Raging Furfag, and Anonymous for content.\n- Lyraeon with FFA and Cap, Courteousfag, and FilteredCoffee with wwyr (IRC at freenode.net #wwyr)\n- Pornodex Guy, Zalgo, Unown, The Boogie, Courteousfag, and Alex for being pretty cool guys.\n- Anonymous, for helping contribute and supporting the project.\n- The Falcon, for inspiring me to make my own copypasta resource to help reduce annoying threads.
