This series tackles four of these exploits, glimpsed through centuries-old literature and art, which were miraculously advanced for their time. Now, historians, technicians and artisans have come together to try to equal their forebears' genius and expertise and understand how these major achievements came about.\n\nPart 1. Crane\nEight hundred years ago, the biggest building boom the world had ever seen exploded across Europe. All over the continent rival towns and cities competed with each other to build vast cathedrals that towered higher than any other buildings in Europe. But this craze for Gothic architecture also called for the development of a machine that could raise enormous quantities of stone to extreme heights. A handful of medieval illustrations show a type of giant crane, perched high on the top of these gothic buildings. Powered by people walking inside a large treadwheel, just how did medieval craftsmen build such cranes? This programme attempts to reconstruct the medieval cathedral crane using traditional methods, but not everything goes according to plan.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 49 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 680 MB\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18fbd5b13ca40506767b2cf347694d79f81d7d44","amp;dn":"Ch4+Machines+Time+Forgot+1of4+Crane+576p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18fbd5b13ca40506767b2cf347694d79f81d7d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,251,213,177,60,164,5,6,118,123,44,243,71,105,77,121,248,29,125,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
