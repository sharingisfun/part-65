He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. But he can't understand why God favored Mozart, such a vulgar creature, to be his instrument.

He is set to take revenge.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:159174a5868badb7558eff51350c3670301ac53f","amp;dn":"Amadeus.1984.720p.BRRip.x264.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"159174a5868badb7558eff51350c3670301ac53f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,145,116,165,134,139,173,183,85,142,255,81,53,12,54,112,48,26,197,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
