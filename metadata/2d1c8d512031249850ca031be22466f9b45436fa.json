The resulting disc can only be played in compatible Blu-Ray devices such as a\nstandalone Blu-Ray player, Playstation 3, or BD-ROM drive. This cannot be played in any\nDVD player, including some DVD-ROM drives, after it's been burned. However, the files can\nalways be dumped back onto a computer hard-drive after it's been burned with any DVD-ROM or\nBD-ROM drive. For computer playback, you must have the appropriate hardware and software\napplications. At a minimum, you will need a 2.0Ghz Dual Core CPU with at least 256MB of\ngraphics memory. There is also the option of recording to a solid-state memory card (SDHC,\nMemory Stick), then played from many Blu-Ray disc players, PS3, or select Panasonic HDTV's.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nYour standalone Blu-Ray player must be capable of AVCHD playback. Most Blu-Ray players are\ncapable of doing this.\n\nBURNING INFORMATION:\n\nAny tool to burn a disk will do, but it must be able to burn a DVD using the UDF 2.50 file\nsystem. The UDF 2.60 file system is also acceptable. Nero Burning ROM can do this starting\nfrom version 7. You can also use free tools like ImgBurn, which can be downloaded from\nwww.imgburn.com.\n\n\nImgburn Step-By-Step Instructions:\n\n* First, switch to &quot;Build&quot; mode by selecting Mode &gt; Build from the main menu.\n* For source, select the directory that contains BDMV directory.\n* For target specify any name and location of your liking, this is where the disc image will\nbe written.\n* Select Options page in the tabbed notebook on the right, specify UDF file system, revision\n2.50.\n* Keep &quot;Recurse subdirectories&quot; checked.\n* Press the folder icon &gt; disc icon button to write the image.\n\nAfter this process is done, locate where you saved the image file (.iso), then burn to a\nregular DVD-R or DVD+R disc. If using a standalone Blu-Ray player, make sure it will play\nwhich ever disc (-R or +R) you are using. I recommend using a burning speed of 4x or less.\n\nOnce completed, you now have a high definition video on a regular DVD ready to be played on\nyour favorite Blu-Ray device.\n\n# MD5 checksums generated by MD5summer (http://www.md5summer.org)\n# Generated 7/20/2011 8:52:01 AM\n\n110152014585f0aaad0234f5e87fc8fc *BDMV/index.bdmv\n3a9b8b02517152a9423c6711eb61345f *BDMV/MovieObject.bdmv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d1c8d512031249850ca031be22466f9b45436fa","amp;dn":"Alice+Cooper%2C+2011-06-11%2CDownload+Festival%2CProshot+AVCHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d1c8d512031249850ca031be22466f9b45436fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,28,141,81,32,49,36,152,80,202,3,27,226,36,102,249,180,84,54,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
