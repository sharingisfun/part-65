Typically these tasks involve using the mouse and keyboard. Simba is programmable, which means you can design your own logic and steps that Simba will follow, based upon certain input.\n\nThis Ã¢â‚¬Å“inputÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can vary greatly; from data in files to colors and text on the screen.\n\nSimba can:\n\n- Find and read colours on the screen.\n- Click or move the mouse to a specific position on the screen. Typically this is the -position of a found color or bitmap.\n- Read text on the screen and turn it into actual text. (Optical Character Recognition)\n- Capture and analyse images on the screen.\n- Read and write files.\n- Connect to the internet to read websites and post data to them.\n- Run pascal programs for you. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a bit creative you can have a lot of fun stuff with Simba, you could even make a game in it!\n\nSimba is being updated almost every day. To see changes as they are added, view https://github.com/MerlijnWajer/Simba\n\n\nHow to install Simba:\n\nSimply run the installer, SimbaInstaller.exe, follow the steps and please make notice of the following note:\nSimba will install to C:/ by default; if you want to install it somewhere else, make sure you select a different location! If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, then you will probably want to install it to C:/ or another place; as long as writing in the actual directory does not require administrator permissions. C:/ is a safe bet.\nYou can install Simba to your Program Files directory, but you will have to run Simba as administrator in that case.\nSimba will probably tell you there is an update available. In this case, an update button will appear. Click it and the Simba Updater will show up. Alternatively you can update Simba using Tools -&gt; Update which will update Simba if there is a new update available.\n\nNote 1:\nUpdating Simba as soon as an update is released is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n- [Melvintjuh]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921ef550ab6aa0a8867b48f8b802600b9fb1b062","amp;dn":"Runescape+SIMBA+Bot+%2APRO%2A+%5B29-5-2012%5D+%5BMelvintjuh%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921ef550ab6aa0a8867b48f8b802600b9fb1b062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,30,245,80,171,106,160,168,134,123,72,248,184,2,96,11,159,177,176,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
