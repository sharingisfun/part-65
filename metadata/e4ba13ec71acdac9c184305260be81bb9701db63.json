It can be used to create a Multiboot USB Flash Drive containing multiple operating systems, antivirus utilities, disc cloning, diagnostic tools, and more. Contrary to MultiBootISO's which used grub to boot ISO files directly from USB, YUMI uses syslinux to boot extracted distributions stored on the USB device, and reverts to using grub to Boot Multiple ISO files from USB, if necessary.\n\nYUMI works much like Universal USB Installer, except it can be used to install more than one distribution to run from your USB. Distributions can also be uninstalled using the same tool!\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in version 0.0.6.2:\nAdded Liberte, Knoppix 7 DVD, Web Converger, and Debian Live 6.0.4 64bit entries.\nShorten cfg files to &lt;=8 characters to prevent potential boot issues.\n\n\nChanges in version 0.0.6.1:\nAdded Kubuntu DVD, and Fedora 17 entries.\nUpdated to support Ophcrack 3.4.0.\nFix Backtrack 5 Removal option.\n\n\nChanges in version 0.0.6.0:\nAdded Wifiway 3.4, and Linux Mint 13 Mate and Cinnamon entries.\n\n\nChanges in version 0.0.5.9:\nAdded Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio 12.04 entries.\n\n\nChanges in version 0.0.5.8:\nRename Linux Mint entries to avoid confusion.\nUpdate Porteus entry.\nAdd Pear OS, Linux Live tools for OCZ, Linux Mint 12 LXDE, and Ubuntu DVD 12.04 entries.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ba13ec71acdac9c184305260be81bb9701db63","amp;dn":"YUMI-0.0.6.2+%26ndash%3B+June+9%2C+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ba13ec71acdac9c184305260be81bb9701db63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,186,19,236,113,172,218,201,193,132,48,82,96,190,129,187,151,1,219,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
