One discovery in particular stands out - a tangle of bones that might belong to a family from two thousand years ago.\nThe trail to uncover answers about what happened to these people leads to a dark world of ritual sacrifice and right back to the limits of British recorded history.\n\nEpisode 2 - The York 113\n\nIn 2008, construction workers just beyond York's city walls uncovered 113 bodies in a mass grave. The History Cold Case team spots an incredibly rare genetic peculiarity in two of the skeletons among the 113 and wonder whether they have stumbled on a pair of brothers, one of whom was severely disabled.\nThe trail to find out who these two men could have been and how they ended up dead in a mass grave outside York opens up a new personalised vantage point on the events surrounding the English Civil War and also gives us a perspective on disability which can perhaps teach us something about so-called modern attitudes today.\n\nEpisode 3 - The Bodies in the Well\n\nProfessor Sue Black and her team use forensic science to shed light on the past. When the remains of 17 people - men, women and 11 children, one as young as two years old - were discovered in a dry well shaft in Norwich city centre, the local community were keen for answers about who these people were and what happened to them. Thought to date from the early 1200s, this becomes a case of suspected medieval murder but the final reveal of the identity of these people is an even bigger shock to all involved.\n\nThe remains of 17 bodies found at the bottom of a medieval well in England could have been victims of persecution, new evidence has suggested. The most likely explanation is that those down the well were Jewish and were probably murdered or forced to commit suicide, according to scientists who used a combination of DNA analysis, carbon dating and bone chemical studies in their investigation.\n\nThe skeletons date back to the 12th or 13th Centuries at a time when Jewish people were facing persecution throughout Europe.\n\nThey were discovered in 2004 during an excavation of a site in the centre of Norwich, ahead of construction of the Chapelfield Shopping Centre. The remains were put into storage and have only recently been the subject of investigation. Seven skeletons were successfully tested and five of them had a DNA sequence suggesting they were likely to be members of a single Jewish family. DNA expert Dr Ian Barnes, who carried out the tests, said: &quot;This is a really unusual situation for us. This is a unique set of data that we have been able to get for these individuals. &quot;I am not aware that this has been done before - that we have been able to pin them down to this level of specificity of the ethnic group that they seem to come from.&quot;\n\nThe team has been led by forensic anthropologist Professor Sue Black, of the University of Dundee's Centre for Anthropology and Human Identification. Professor Black, who went to the Balkans following the Kosovo war - where her job was to piece together the bodies of massacred Kosovan Albanians - said this discovery had changed the direction of the whole investigation. Regarding the nature of the discovery, Professor Black said: &quot;We are possibly talking about persecution. We are possibly talking about ethnic cleansing and this all brings to mind the scenario that we dealt with during the Balkan War crimes.&quot; Eleven of the 17 skeletons were those of children aged between two and 15. The remaining six were adult men and women. &quot;In terms of the brutality of the ethnic cleansing, it was thought women and children quite frankly weren't worth wasting the bullets on,&quot; added Professor Black. &quot;Pregnant women were bayoneted because that way you got rid of a woman because that wasn't important and you got rid of the next generation because you didn't want them to survive. So I know what sort of pattern I am looking for.&quot;\n\nPictures taken at the time of excavation suggested the bodies were thrown down the well together, head first. A close examination of the adult bones showed fractures caused by the impact of hitting the bottom of the well. But the same damage was not seen on the children's bones, suggesting they were thrown in after the adults who cushioned the fall of their bodies. The team had earlier considered the possibility of death by disease but the bone examination also showed no evidence of diseases such as leprosy or tuberculosis. Giles Emery, the archaeologist who led the original excavation, said at first he thought it might have been a plague burial, but carbon dating had shown that to be impossible as the plague came much later. And historians pointed out that even during times of plague when mass graves were used, bodies were buried in an ordered way with respect and religious rites.\nNorwich had been home to a thriving Jewish community since 1135 and many lived near the well site. But there are records of persecution of Jews in medieval England including in Norwich.\nSophie Cabot, an archaeologist and expert on Norwich's Jewish history, said the Jewish people had been invited to England by the King to lend money because at the time, the Christian interpretation of the bible did not allow Christians to lend money and charge interest. It was regarded as a sin.\nSo cash finance for big projects came from the Jewish community and some became very wealthy - which in turn, caused friction. &quot;There is a resentment of the fact that Jews are making money... and they are doing it in a way that doesn't involve physical labour, things that are necessarily recognised as work... like people feel about bankers now,&quot; said Ms Cabot. The findings of the investigation represented a sad day for Norwich. Ms Cabot added: &quot;It changes the story of what we know about the community. We don't know everything about the community but what we do know is changed by this.&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0da1077aabe1484a88728bf16e82b8787eb8217","amp;dn":"History+Cold+Case++%28BBC+-+Season+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0da1077aabe1484a88728bf16e82b8787eb8217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,218,16,119,170,190,20,132,168,135,40,191,22,232,43,135,135,235,130,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
