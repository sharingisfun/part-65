Camera! Teen Angst! When a group of friends decide to make a movie over a long summer holiday, they end up learning a little about filmmaking and a lot more about each other and themselves. What begins as a simple way to avoid the summer doldrums quickly turns into something much more complex, intimate and revealing, as the maturing relationships between the members of the young cast take on new, and sometimes very unexpected, turns. Get ready for a whole new take on summer romance as hidden emotions get captured and secrets meant to be kept hidden inside young hearts instead spill off of the screen for your viewing pleasure in Waiting in the Summer!\n\nCategories: Aliens, High School, Humanoid, Romance, School Life, Seinen\n\n\nEncoder: SNetcQzIIqRWgW","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c91ed9cbfadefba604bab1134018524a8f3510","amp;dn":"%5BSilent-Raws%5D+Ano+Natsu+de+Matteru+%28AT-X+1280x720+x264+AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c91ed9cbfadefba604bab1134018524a8f3510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,201,30,217,203,250,222,251,166,4,186,177,19,64,24,82,74,143,53,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
