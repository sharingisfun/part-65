NFO .............\n-Release: The.Devils.Ride.S01E01.READNFO.iNTERNAL.720p.HDTV.x264-YesTV\nReleasedate: 22 May 2012\nGenre: Documentary\nURL: http://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-31624\nRes: 1280x720\nFps: 23.976\n\n--crf 20 slower\n\nDiscovery fucked this episode up in a bad way which is\nwhy this isn't tagged proper. KILLERS release is missing\n1min 40sec of footage somewhere. I can't be arsed to find\nout where exactly when it's not a proper. Look at it as \nmore some kind of info for those interested. \n\nThey also left their rip at 29.97 and since so many frames \nare blended if you skip frame by frame there are no exact\ndupes, just excess amount of blended frames.\n\nSo what it comes down to is picking between two evils \nreally. We chose to ivtc since it save some bitrate for \nmore important places and to be in unison with E02 and\nthe rest of the series, hopefully.\n\nPlayback is unsmooth in both cases and some blending\nwill always be there. It is just a bit less in our rip\nand in our opinion the viewing experience is better.\nIt's just a matter of taste because both are far from\nperfect. But at least this one is complete.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad46206f792e090f50202064f466b74d1319a1e3","amp;dn":"The.Devils.Ride.S01E01.READNFO.iNTERNAL.720p.HDTV.x264-YesTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad46206f792e090f50202064f466b74d1319a1e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,70,32,111,121,46,9,15,80,32,32,100,244,102,183,77,19,25,161,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
