They mix machine-gun rap/punk lines and melodic female vocals with infectious guitar/bass/keyboard rhythms and driving beats and their original lyrics are a challenging blend of the social, personal &amp; political. \n\nTheir explosive and energetic live performances, complete with projections, lights, smoke etc, also include distinctive cover versions of ProdigyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“BREATHEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, RATMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guerilla RadioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &amp; Regurgitators &quot;SUCKER&quot;, reflecting a broad range of musical influences. The MOLOTOVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest demo Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last Rites 4 CapitalismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has been described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a hard-hitting and refreshing hybrid of stylesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &amp; their latest EP &quot;MANIFESTO&quot; is on the way. Their sound is in constant evolution &amp; can only really be conveyed in live performance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc16f91d8cefb03ceabd96f323d2e772832f3dc","amp;dn":"The+Molotov+EP+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc16f91d8cefb03ceabd96f323d2e772832f3dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,193,111,145,216,206,251,3,206,171,217,111,50,61,46,119,40,50,243,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
