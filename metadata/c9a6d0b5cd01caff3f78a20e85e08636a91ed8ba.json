The French phrase &quot;ants in the palms,&quot; (which means that someone is &quot;itching&quot; to kill) is shown literally. A man pulls a piano along with the tablets of the Ten Commandments and a dead donkey towards the woman he's itching to kill. A shot of differently striped objects is repeatedly used to connect scenes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a6d0b5cd01caff3f78a20e85e08636a91ed8ba","amp;dn":"Un+Chien+Andalou+1929+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a6d0b5cd01caff3f78a20e85e08636a91ed8ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,166,208,181,205,1,202,255,63,120,162,14,133,224,134,54,169,30,216,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
