It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a6fb9a6aec09d65d61b1288f39a7ec02115d434","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+13+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a6fb9a6aec09d65d61b1288f39a7ec02115d434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,111,185,166,174,192,157,101,214,27,18,136,243,154,126,192,33,21,212,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
