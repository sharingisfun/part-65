It uses routine financial calculations as the motivation and basis for tools of elementary real analysis rather than taking the latter as given. Proofs using induction, recurrence relations and proofs by contradiction are covered. Inequalities such as the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality and the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality are used. Basic topics in probability and statistics are presented. The student is introduced to elements of saving and investing that are of life-long practical use. These include savings and checking accounts, certificates of deposit, student loans, credit cards, mortgages, buying and selling bonds, and buying and selling stocks.\n\nThe book is self contained and accessible. The authors follow a systematic pattern for each chapter including a variety of examples and exercises ensuring that the student deals with realities, rather than theoretical idealizations. It is suitable for courses in mathematics, investing, banking, financial engineering, and related topics.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 312 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (October 24, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0387344322\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0387344324","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a87e38772e297b9f95985380a0b59f0f72bd4a","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+the+Mathematics+of+Money%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a87e38772e297b9f95985380a0b59f0f72bd4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,168,126,56,119,46,41,123,159,149,152,83,128,160,181,159,15,114,189,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
