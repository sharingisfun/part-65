There is a new kind of calibration data at 1FF80 that is different in \n2 occurances (so far) so if you get a PLAY DVD error then you need to redump your original \nwith the new upcoming JF and let that do its magic for you. \n\nFYI The other variation is the factory updated version, and this difference at 1FF80 was only \ndiscovered in the last week so bear with us as there may be more variations out there.\n\nYou know if you have a factory upgraded version if the label says 9504 but the fw is 0225 ;)\n\nIncluded OFW files explained:\n\n1. Orig-0272.bin - 0272 (Retail 9504 flashed to new dash over XBL)\n2. Orig-0225.bin - Retail 0225\n3. Orig-0225u.bin - Retail 9504 flashed at factory to 0225u ... big differences in sector 1FF00 (calibration data at 1FF80)\n4. Orig-0401.bin - Retail 0401\n\nThanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.\nThanks as always go to Team Xecuter for their generous support to this whole project. \n\nSpecial thanks go to Foundmy.com for their help with the 0401 drives and the factory updated 0225 drives !\n\n\n\nJungleFlasher 0.1.85(257) \n========================================\nSupport for LT Plus 1.9 Liteon(slim):\n-0272\n-0225\n-0225u (factory updated 9504 to 0225)\n-0401 \n\nSupport for set Spi Lock status register on: \n- XECUTER DG-16D4S UNLOCKED PCB\n- XECUTER DG-16D4S PRO INSTALL KIT\n\nSupport to extract and patch calibration data at 0x1FF80. \nIn some cases 0225 may give \\&quot;Play DVD\\&quot; error randomly, without this data.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c92542cefa31eb2c58695f3843aa12391405ed","amp;dn":"C4E%5C%27s+iXtreme+Slim+LT%2B+1.9+%2B+JungleFlasher.0.1.85.Beta%28257%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c92542cefa31eb2c58695f3843aa12391405ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,201,37,66,206,250,49,235,44,88,105,95,56,67,170,18,57,20,5,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
