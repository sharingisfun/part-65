The cost of a hardware failure can be enormous. If you are lucky your data will only become inaccessible while faulty components are replaced. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re unlucky you can lose your files completely or have them permanently corrupted. Even if you have good backups, you can still lose days of work returning the PC to its pre-failure state. In many cases the lost data can never be replaced and businesses can be brought to their knees, with the loss of documentation, customer details and financial records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:791cd0af909ad319c77b06e7923b1b7ed9a80d81","amp;dn":"Burn+In+Test+Pro+with+SERIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"791cd0af909ad319c77b06e7923b1b7ed9a80d81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,28,208,175,144,154,211,25,199,123,6,231,146,59,27,126,217,168,13,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
