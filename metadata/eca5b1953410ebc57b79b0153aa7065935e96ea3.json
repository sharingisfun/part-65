The documentary shows interviews with participants and voice re-enactments based on the actual court transcripts. The Dover trial was the first legal test of intelligent design as a scientific theory and is a landmark court case that set a precedent for all separation of church and state court cases to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eca5b1953410ebc57b79b0153aa7065935e96ea3","amp;dn":"NOVA.Judgement.Day-Intelligent.Design.on.Trial.HDTV-MiRAGETV-CD1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eca5b1953410ebc57b79b0153aa7065935e96ea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,165,177,149,52,16,235,197,123,121,176,21,58,167,6,89,53,233,110,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
