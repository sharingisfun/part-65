This is posted here and was created entirely because of the upload by neon and neon's comment in response to two people.  \n\nThe BD had it as 4 parts with rolling credits at the beginning and end of each part because it is a mini-series (or serial in the UK) not a movie of longer than average feature length. If you think editing the mini-series into a single file is a hack butchering of the programme then this is probably for you. \n\nIf there is a demand for it i can put up the 720p release by GaGE. Since these were made HAGGiS has come out with a DVDrip of this too but they accidentally numbered the parts wrong and so it hasn't seen such wide distribution.\n\n\n\nFILE SPECS\n    Title : Titanic.2012.Part.1.BDRiP.XviD-jAh.avi\n    Air Date : 21 March 2012 (Canada)\n    Release Date : 23 April 2012\n    Channel : Global / TV3 / itv / ABC       \n    Source : Titanic.2012.S01E01.720p.BluRay.x264-GaGE.mkv\n    Video Resolution : 624x352\n    Frame Rate : 25.000\n    Duration : 45.06                        \n                                 \n    Audio Format : mp3\n    Audio Bit Rate : 128 kbps vbr\n       \n    File Size : 366 852 096 bytes  or  349.86 MB\n\n\n\nIN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY\nHugh, Earl of Manton sets out on the maiden voyage of Titanic, the pride of the \nWhite Star Line, with his wife Louisa and rebellious suffragette daughter \nGeorgiana.
