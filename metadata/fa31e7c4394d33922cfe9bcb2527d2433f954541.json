The statement claims two organisations, Truth in Science and Creation Ministries International are &quot;touring the UK and presenting themselves as scientists and their creationist views as science&quot;.\n\n&quot;Creationism and intelligent design are not scientific theories, but they are portrayed as scientific theories by some religious fundamentalists who attempt to have their views promoted in publicly funded schools,&quot; the scientists say.\n\n&quot;There should be enforceable statutory guidance that they may not be presented as scientific theories in any publicly funded school of whatever type.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa31e7c4394d33922cfe9bcb2527d2433f954541","amp;dn":"Richard+Dawkins+Radio+4+PM+19-09-2011.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa31e7c4394d33922cfe9bcb2527d2433f954541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,49,231,196,57,77,51,146,44,254,155,203,37,39,210,67,63,149,69,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
