The writing, arranging, rehearsing and recording of this CD took about 2 years. There is a lot of other material that didn't make it onto the album. ~ C.J. Otis\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:486f6f5044f7f3c037e893b6a6ae324d37d22828","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+The+Roadhouse+Jukes+-+What%5C%27s+Gotta+Be+Done","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"486f6f5044f7f3c037e893b6a6ae324d37d22828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,111,111,80,68,247,243,192,55,232,147,182,166,174,50,77,55,210,40,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
