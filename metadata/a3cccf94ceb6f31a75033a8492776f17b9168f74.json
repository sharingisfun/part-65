Why, do you ask?  Because that one will need 999.99 GB's of free space once that one is unpacked...  Do you see where I'm going with this..  Sorry for any .rar errors, I tried my best, but the errors should be false, I moved the directories of some files to different folder locations, so they should be in there somewhere..  These ARKs are too good to split up..  Demonoid has too low of a size limit to get anything up besides books and images...  ;(\n\n\nPlease try to Start w/ the &quot;What On Earth Is Happening&quot; folder (movies).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://whatonearthishappening.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://whatonearthishappening.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oraclebroadcasting.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oraclebroadcasting.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.americanfreedomradio.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.americanfreedomradio.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nuse the &quot;Software..&quot; folder for any issues opening a file..  If there are some files that linux or mac users have trouble viewing (probably located in the &quot;Books..&quot; folder for trouble reading random book files, use the internet!)\n\n\n\nI'm sorry Ark II is not as neat as Ark I, but you are free to re-organize to fit your style of folder structure.  This is a never-ending process, but remember, All is Love, Fear is an Illusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Neo_X_Killua_45","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3cccf94ceb6f31a75033a8492776f17b9168f74","amp;dn":"WAKEUP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3cccf94ceb6f31a75033a8492776f17b9168f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,204,207,148,206,182,243,26,117,3,58,132,146,119,111,23,185,22,143,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
