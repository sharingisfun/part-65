Enjoy and once again thanks are appreciated.\n\nThis wonderful Walt Disney film is the Civil War adventure/historical drama loosely based on the true story of Johnny Clem, the Drummer Boy of Chickamauga. They call the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJohnny ShilohÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ due to the Shiloh battle in the movie. In the film, it is 1861 and little Johnny Clem has run away to become a drummer boy at the age of 10 for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Blue MaraudersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ platoon of the Union Army. He canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stand them going to war without him since he has drilled with them as their mascot drummer in his hometown for so long before getting their orders move out. He is too young to serve at 10 and he is returned home, only to run back again. The next strategy of the Union Army is to wear him down by treating him like a real soldier, but his heart just wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give up. He is allowed to stay on as a real drummer. After showing incredible bravery on the battlefield as a drummer during a fierce battle, and saving his seargentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life by shooting a Confederate officer that is about to strike him down, Johnny gets promoted to seargent and assigned as a messenger to the general. He is captured by the Confederates and must escape to deliver valuable information to his general that could affect the outcome of the next big battle.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d768a3377d83b1a7be664df227116565398227cc","amp;dn":"Disney+Movie+-+Johnny+Shiloh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d768a3377d83b1a7be664df227116565398227cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,104,163,55,125,131,177,167,190,102,77,242,39,17,101,101,57,130,39,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
