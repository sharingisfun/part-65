In simplified mode (default), only the essential hardware information is displayed: graphics card name, temperatures (GPU, PCB) and clocks (GPU, memory and shader). When accessing the detailed mode, you will be able to view more information, including the GPU codename, driver and BIOS versions, or the device ID.\n\nThe main feature of GPU-Shark is to monitor all available GPUs and visualize them all in a single window. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the fundamental difference with GPU Caps Viewer. Indeed GPU Caps is focused on the main graphics card, the one that can run OpenGL and Direct3D apps.\n\nWith GPU Caps, you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have access to the information of secondary cards. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, GPU Caps has many other features like OpenCL or CUDA data and has several real time 3D demos (OpenGL and OpenCL). All these features have a drawback: GPU Caps comes with several files (DLLs and demos data).\n\nozone3d.net\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28cf2f3d25e871bdf033c7c0cd4f63f586562fb5","amp;dn":"GPUShark+0.6.3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28cf2f3d25e871bdf033c7c0cd4f63f586562fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,207,47,61,37,232,113,189,240,51,199,192,205,79,99,245,134,86,47,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
