For the first time ever, the palace of the peaks, Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, has opened its doors to the cameras for a whole year. It is a unique opportunity to take an in-depth glimpse of life upstairs and downstairs in the 21st century.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nThe first programme joins the 12th duke and duchess as the house is being prepared to open to the public. It is the busiest time of year for the house staff and everyone has a role to play - even the duke and duchess, as they join the annual litter pick around the estate. 2011 sees the six month probation period of the youngest and very first female head guide, Heather Redmond. Will she win over the 60-strong guide team, some of whom have worked at Chatsworth since before she was born, and get the job for keeps? Chatsworth's award-winning farm shop is presided over by manager Andre Birkett. Man and boy he has worked for the family, starting in the kitchens of the house.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/2408/chatsworthscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/2408/chatsworthscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img860.imageshack.us/img860/626/chatsworthscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img860.imageshack.us/img860/626/chatsworthscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/5108/chatsworthscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/5108/chatsworthscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3498/chatsworthscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3498/chatsworthscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/843/chatsworthscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/843/chatsworthscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/1343/chatsworthscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/1343/chatsworthscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2234/chatsworthscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2234/chatsworthscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/1571/chatsworthscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/1571/chatsworthscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/4135/chatsworthscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/4135/chatsworthscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1642 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatsworth_House&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatsworth_House&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db6f63612b78a64267776f651c57215eb2a6c50","amp;dn":"BBC+Chatsworth+1of3+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db6f63612b78a64267776f651c57215eb2a6c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,182,246,54,18,183,138,100,38,119,118,246,81,197,114,21,235,42,108,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
