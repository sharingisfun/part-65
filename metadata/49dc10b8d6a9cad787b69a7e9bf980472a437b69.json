Wolverine is a mutant, possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical \ncapabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him \nto recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Wolverine[/b]\n================\n\nNo.  Title \tOriginal airdate   English airdate\n---- -------  ------------------- -----------------\n\n08 &quot;Koh&quot; September 16, 2011 \n&quot;KÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½&quot; (ÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â»Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â½Ã…Â¾KOH)  February 25, 2011\n\nAs a broadcast of Yukio's location is sent to Koh's base, Logan says he will go \nsave her first rather than let her die to get his revenge, with Koh believing \nthe opposite. Making a deal that Logan will distract Kurohagi when he arrives at Dragon Palace so that he and his men can attack, Koh gives Logan a map with a direct route to Dragon Palace named &quot;Hell Road&quot; due to its history of people going in but dying when they are caught. As the grunts watch Yukio play with her weapon, they reveal that they have automated-military grade weaponry guarding the bunker. When the men go to sleep, Yukio frees herself with her weapon being on the wall, but is tranquilized when Kurohagi checks on the men. The one in charge of guarding Yukio is killed by a dart of a more potent and lethal version of the one used on Logan at the Yashida home. Logan easily \ndisables this system and uses the ammo to break through the door of the bunker and unties Yukio. Logan picks up a tranq-dart, and takes it with him as the duo head for Hell Road.  \n \n \nSpoken Language: English\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n---------\n\n[URL=http://img694.imageshack.us/i/wolverine108kohojavithu.jpg/][IMG]http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4731/wolverine108kohojavithu.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 176M\nPlayTime           : 00:19:57.997\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 35904\nVideoBitRate       : 1093894\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nHash:\n------\n49DC10B8D6A9CAD787B69A7E9BF980472A437B69\n--------------------------------\n[/center]\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace onfor more Cartoons and Anime.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49dc10b8d6a9cad787b69a7e9bf980472a437b69","amp;dn":"Wolverine+-+108+-+Koh+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49dc10b8d6a9cad787b69a7e9bf980472a437b69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,220,16,184,214,169,202,215,135,182,154,126,155,249,128,71,42,67,123,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
