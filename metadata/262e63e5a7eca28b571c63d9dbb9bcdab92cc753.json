Dutton\n\n\n\n::Plot::\n  The Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) falls to Earth in Los Angeles. He cuts off his wings and steals a police car \n\nafter a policeman kills another officer because the former is possessed. He then heads for the Paradise Falls diner, \n\nnear the edge of the Mojave Desert.\nMeanwhile, Kyle (Tyrese Gibson), a single father driving to L.A., stops at the diner. There he meets the owner, Bob \n\nHanson (Dennis Quaid); his son Jeep (Lucas Black); the short-order cook Percy (Charles S. Dutton); a pregnant \n\nwaitress, Charlie (Adrianne Palicki); a married couple, Howard and Sandra Anderson (Jon Tenney and Kate Walsh), \n\nand their rebellious teenage daughter, Audrey (Willa Holland).\nAn old woman enters the diner. She seems pleasant at first, but then begins taunting the diner's patrons. When Howard \n\ntries to reason with her, she rips his throat open, screeches that they are all going to die and climbs up the ceiling like \n\nan insect. Kyle shoots her with a handgun after she attacks Bob. Percy, Jeep and the diner patrons try to hurry an \n\ninjured Howard away in Kyle's SUV, but are forced to go back after passing through a swarm of horse flies.\nMichael arrives and arms the patrons as the entire sky plunges into blackness. Michael leads the patrons to fight off a \n\nlarge number of possessed people that arrive. They drag off Howard and cease their attack. He explains that God has \n\nlost faith in mankind and has sent down his angels to destroy the human race. He also reveals that Charlie's baby is \n\ndeemed to be the savior of mankind, and that it must stay alive if humanity is to have any hope of surviving. Michael also \n\nreveals that his original mission was to kill Charlie's baby, but he disagreed with God's orders, as he still has faith in \n\nthe goodness of humanity.\nThe next morning, Sandra discovers Howard crucified behind the restaurant and covered with boils. She tries to \n\nrescue him, but he violently explodes. Percy shields Sandra from the blast and is killed, while Sandra is driven insane. \n\nMeanwhile, the patrons manage to catch a radio transmission revealing that there are other pockets of survivors holding \n\nout against the possessed, with one such refuge nearby. However, Michael advises not to go, since they would be too \n\nvulnerable on the move. That night, a second wave of possessed attack, luring Kyle out by pretending to have a father \n\nand his son show up and having the father run over, motivating Kyle to run out to save the child. The child turns out to \n\nbe possessed, kills Kyle, and attacks Audrey, but Michael intervenes and guns down many possessed. The attack pushes \n\na panicked Charlie into labor. She delivers the baby as trumpets sound, signaling the approach of the Archangel Gabriel \n\n(Kevin Durand), who is leading the attack on humanity. In a panic, Sandra breaks her restraints and tries to give the \n\nbaby to the possessed, so Michael kills her.\nMoments later, Gabriel is sent by God. When Gabriel reaches the diner, he seriously injures Bob, and Michael gives \n\nJeep the keys to the police cruiser he arrived in, urging them to escape. The hordes of possessed humans are unable to \n\napproach Charlie's baby, so Jeep, Audrey, Charlie, and her baby make their way to the cruiser. Gabriel and Michael \n\nfight, ending with Gabriel stabbing Michael through the chest with his mace. Michael dies and his body disappears. Bob \n\nlights a flame to the diner's gas main, blowing up the diner and destroying himself and the remaining hordes of \n\npossessed.\nJeep's body gets covered in the same mysterious drawings seen on Michael's body. Gabriel then shows up, having \n\nsurvived, and swoops down on the fleeing car. As he tries to reach Charlie, Audrey jumps on him and sacrifices herself \n\nafter she yells at Jeep to slam on the brakes, sending Gabriel through the front windshield as the car crashes. Charlie \n\nand Jeep survive with the baby, but Charlie indicates that Audrey did not survive the crash. Gabriel finally corners \n\nJeep and Charlie in the nearby mountains. He is about to kill them when Michael appears from Heaven, an angel once \n\nmore, and stops Gabriel. Michael tells Gabriel that he (Michael) did what God needed, not what God wanted, thus giving \n\nhumanity another chance. With his angelic powers back, Michael easily defeats Gabriel, but spares his life after which \n\nGabriel leaves, defeated. Michael explains to Jeep that he is the child's true protector, then flies off. Charlie and \n\nJeep make it to the top of the mountain and see a small town in the valley below.\nSometime later, Charlie, Jeep, and the baby are seen driving off into the distance with a car full of weapons, after \n\nwhich the credits roll.\n\n::Trackers::\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nyaatorrents.info:3277/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nyaatorrents.info:3277/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInfo Hash:4963D97832AEED16DF494EC3595EA5AEB2E2F1A1 \n\n\n\n::Screenshots::\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fVtKT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fVtKT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mUeBe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mUeBe.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tdyPo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tdyPo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/N0Ksh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/N0Ksh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YWSXZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YWSXZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZBPvN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZBPvN.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DmVxM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DmVxM.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/x3tB6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/x3tB6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dseA4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dseA4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n::Greetz::\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch,Emad,TrT/TcT,Torrentstate,DarkNight,MXMG,BigW &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n\n\n::Note::\n  Make sure its real Silver RG Release From Silvertorrents.me,A video sample is included in the folder for those who \n\nwant to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:262e63e5a7eca28b571c63d9dbb9bcdab92cc753","amp;dn":"Legion+%282010%29+720p+BRRip+x264+Aac+Dual+Audio%7BEng-Hin%7D+%5BEng+Subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"262e63e5a7eca28b571c63d9dbb9bcdab92cc753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,46,99,229,167,236,162,139,87,28,99,217,219,185,188,218,185,44,199,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
