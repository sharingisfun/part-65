The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:008898f032a9df5ee7adcf48404991fd3cc7d359","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+Blue+-+8.162+-+French+-+Diskettes.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"008898f032a9df5ee7adcf48404991fd3cc7d359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,136,152,240,50,169,223,94,231,173,207,72,64,73,145,253,60,199,211,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
