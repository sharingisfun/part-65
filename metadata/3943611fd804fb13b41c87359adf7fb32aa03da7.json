The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3943611fd804fb13b41c87359adf7fb32aa03da7","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+Server+4+-+8.234+-+German+-+CDROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3943611fd804fb13b41c87359adf7fb32aa03da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,67,97,31,216,4,251,19,180,28,135,53,154,223,127,179,42,160,61,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
