I had to choose  from what I believe is the first season 22 of the Most Popular Jetson Episodes. The DVD is well over 4 gigs full of data so I packed in as many cartoons as wuld fit on the blank DVD.\n\nThis is a data-DVD for Computer play back on large monitors, it is NOT a DVD in TV's popular DVD format. The cartoons from the mid 1960's were a spin off of from the longer running 1950's Flintstones cartoons. Within these Jetson episodes it is obvious, like many other cartoons of the 40s and 50's, that these cartoons were aimed at a fairly mature adult market, and not so much at kids at all. The Jetsons told us as much about mid 1960's life as it did as much about the future as they seen it.\n\nEach cartoon is in crystal clear Xvid format (Generic DivX and free to use) and will play on many media players, but I personally advise using free &quot;VLC&quot; to view this DVD with, as other media players have more glitches and bugs when playing generic DivX clone formats than the ever so popular VLC does (And it plays on Macs and/or Windows too!).\n\nMy upload is much like the first season talked about here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055683/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055683/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nHowever keep in mind this is not an exact copy, the episodes wil vary and they will only play on medica players supported Xvid, or just maybe if you are very lucky, a TV's DVD player might have a small chance of playing it if it is built right (Some inexpensive ones work fine for this).\n\n\nCouple Thumb Pics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LAJCOAAdd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LAJCOAAdd&lt;/a&gt; car\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAJccaadd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAJccaadd&lt;/a&gt; best jetson background and colors\n\nPeace.\n***********************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91e3995280cabbaf32b36639359a255535cc99b0","amp;dn":"The+Jetsons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91e3995280cabbaf32b36639359a255535cc99b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,227,153,82,128,202,187,175,50,179,102,57,53,154,37,85,53,204,153,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
