Besieged from all sides, the remaining Dragon Riders come out of hiding. Forced to fight for their lives, they leave the safety of the desert, traveling across the land to gather intelligence and shore up forgotten alliances.\n\nAt the center of it all is Elias Dorgumir, the key to an ancient prophesy, and Vosper will do anything to get his hands on him. Is it too late for the Dragon Riders to save Elias and stop Vosper from destroying the only refuge they have left?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4f8fc42fdf492870eb8ee102a4b53eb8766328","amp;dn":"Return-of-the-Dragon-Riders-Book-Two-of-the-Dragon-Stone-Saga.az","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4f8fc42fdf492870eb8ee102a4b53eb8766328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,79,143,196,47,223,73,40,112,235,142,225,2,164,181,62,184,118,99,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
