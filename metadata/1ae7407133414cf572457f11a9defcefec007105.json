Michael Redgrave is all cool rationality, Denholm Elliot repressed anxiety, and Alexander Knox the sceptic who becomes increasingly unhinged by fear, then philosophically resigned to the inevitable. It's a welcome addition to the list that will never make it as an in-flight movie. If you're nervous about flying, don't watch it.
