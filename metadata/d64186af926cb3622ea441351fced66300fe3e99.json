The double album was issued on 7 June 1976 in the United States, on Capitol Records (catalogue number SKBO 11537), and on Parlophone (PCSP 719) in the United Kingdom, four days later;[2] at the time, some in the media speculated that the album was released to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the first meeting between John Lennon and Paul McCartney. (If that was indeed the intention, EMI miscalculated, as the two actually first met in July 1957.) The title, Rock 'n' Roll Music, presumably came from the song of the same name by Chuck Berry, The Beatles' version of which is included on side two of the original two-record set. The album is primarily made up of cover versions of songs written by significant rock and roll composers of the '50s, including Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins and Larry Williams, although some notable LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartney originals, such as &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; are included also. Rock 'n' Roll Music was the first Beatles album to include &quot;I'm Down&quot;, which had previously only been available as the B-side of the &quot;Help!&quot; single.\n\nDesde Wikipedia:\n\nRock 'n' Roll Music es un ÃƒÂ¡lbum recopilatorio de The Beatles.
