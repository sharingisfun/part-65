In confession, Stanfield tells Goddard that he has       \n    accidentally murdered his friend Blakey and buried him in the forest.    \n    When Goddard investigates the matter, he finds a buried scarecrow.       \n    Goddard is outraged, but, due to the seal of confession, he knows he     \n    cannot expel Stanfield. Shortly after, Stanfield once again enters       \n    the confession booth, telling Goddard that what before was a             \n    practical joke, he has now made happen. In disbelief, Goddard once       \n    again goes to the forest to investigate the matter. This time, he        \n    discovers Blakey's dead body.
