That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\n     As you may know, I'm stuck i the mid 20th century, and I almost never read modern comics. Not because I don't have them as it might seem. Not a few slip through a random time vortex and make it to Joe's Soda &amp; Drugs down the street.  Old Joe's eyes are pretty bad these day, and he considers them all foolishness anyway, so he pays them little attention except at the cash register (every dime helps) and just puts them on the rack. I buy any that come in so I can  I share them with you all. I don't read them as they are not my favorite and  choices must be made. &quot;who has time to read the tens upon tens of thousands of digital comics I have? I haven't run a count in quite a while and can't right now but I passed 100,000 a long time ago. 120k? 130k? I just don't know.\n  Well any way I was having a some shoe-string fries and a  coke float (with a shot of cherry syrup -they should sell it that way) at Joes'. I glanced at some of the &quot;New 52 that are staring to come out&quot;. Justice League, Action, Detective. I see that the themes in Justice League and Action are familiar ones - the heroes are just starting out, nobody know a thing about them and they are wanted by the law, as it was  in the beginning of super heroes comics. Even robin came along before Batman stopped being a wanted man. \n    So then I look at detective number one which is jarring enough with the modern &quot;evolved seeming&quot; Batman and t's Keith Ledger influenced Joker instead of the classic 40s Joker I like (who was a cold blood killer, don't confuse him without the silver age joker but not like today's arkham inmate either).My mind associates Batman's beginning with the very early golden age Batman - this guy just doesn't seem like a beginner. Then I see he's answering the mother loving Bat-Signal! and has been around long enough for James G. to say &quot;all you've done for this city&quot;. I read enough to know his status is till very shaky except with the commissioner. So? - It's not a very clandestine way to contact him when he's not official or desirable in the eyes of many. I guess they couldn't reset that iconic searchlight. Haven't these guy's ever heard of high tech mumbo jumbo &quot;scrambled untraceable&quot; methods of signaling? Heck Batman and Robin had belt radios in the 40s. That was a very small and high tech device for the times - just look at a WWII walkie-talkie!  So 70 years later and the best they can do is still a searchlight on the station roof? That's fine when many of the police and the Mayor aren't trying to arrest or even kill you. Gordon would be fired faster than he could say &quot;but Mayor..&quot;\n\nOh, why do I care. I just love to make fun and find flaws. Maybe if I actually read some of the new series this would become more clear, but I never let the facts stand in the way of my exposition. Attack, analyze, find the cracks,  find my mistakes, change course, pretend I was always taking the same position from the start -  you just &quot;misunderstood&quot;. Either way I'm right. \n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from  Nex-Our E\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nThe Next 01-06 (2006-2007)\n\n       Good old Bulletman - Once a star of comics, a hero among heroes, a 50 caliber machine gun power house, now a second stringer at best with DC. Maybe better than a  2mm  Kolibri (perhaps the smallest bullet ever sold) , but still, his glory days are long past. He's spent.\n\nNickel Comics 01-08 (Fawcett(1940)-Bulletman\n\nNight force, night owls, night tribes  nightwings, nightfall, nightmare, nightmaster - are you sensing at trend here? It's one of your more popular starting title words. Would day force, day hawks, day tribes  daywings, day rise, day fright &amp;  day master work as well. No!  Evil men love the night they say, and where they go the heroes follow. Or maybe they can't sleep.\n\nNight Force-Special Preview (excerpt from another comic)\nNight Force v1 01-14 (1982)\nNight Force v2 01-12 (1996)\nNight Owls, The 1-3 (Zudacomics-DC Web(2007-2009)\nNight Tribes (WS(1999)\nNightWings (1986) (Not Nightwing)\nNightfall-The Black Chronicles 01-03 (Homage(2000)\n\nThere's a lot of Elm street related comics.

FIrst he's fired and replaced (and talks about this very thing to Superman). Then  Azrael gets the nod when the Batman is hurt . Then Dick finally gets to wear the cowl when Azreal gets a little &quot;enthusiastic&quot; and has to be stopped. Then Bruce promptly gets well. So later the Battle for the Cowl&quot; after Batman vanishes, but of course once again Mr. Wayne shows up, all rumors of the death of the caped crusader being exaggerated. Just a little time trip. And Dick is out again. I wondered if he'd be robin again in &quot;The New 52&quot;, but NIghtwing #1 is one of the 52.\n\nEver notice DC is a bit fixed on &quot;52&quot; The &quot;52 weekly series&quot;, the 52 world &quot;mini-multverse&quot; (which was &quot;the secret of 52&quot;, now the &quot;New 52&quot;.  I think this will stop after 52 crises, reboots. &amp; relaunches.
