It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a97cbdb0a1e00fe431c0388f2912b1c6887ad467","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+11+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a97cbdb0a1e00fe431c0388f2912b1c6887ad467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,124,189,176,161,224,15,228,49,192,56,143,41,18,177,198,136,122,212,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
