After a mission to rescue a hostage in Barcelona, Mallory is quickly dispatched on another mission to Dublin. When the operation goes awry and Mallory finds she has been double crossed, she needs to use all of her skills, tricks and abilities to escape an international manhunt, make it back to the United States, protect her family, and exact revenge on those that have betrayed her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06664bfb8161bb7e7b9115c32d8fa6065aae427c","amp;dn":"Haywire+2011+Region+1+NTSC+English+%26amp%3B+French+audio.+English+s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06664bfb8161bb7e7b9115c32d8fa6065aae427c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,102,75,251,129,97,187,126,123,145,21,195,45,143,166,6,90,174,66,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
