But unbeknownst to Perseus, a struggle for supremacy has been raging between the gods that will come to threaten his idyllic life. The gods are losing control over the imprisoned Titans and their ferocious leader, Kronos, father of the long-ruling brothers Zeus, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston). The triumvirate had overthrown their powerful father long ago, leaving him to rot in the gloomy abyss of Tartarus, a dungeon that lies deep within the cavernous Underworld. Now, Perseus cannot ignore his true calling as Hades, along with Zeus' godly son, Ares (Edgar Ramirez), switches loyalties and makes a deal with Kronos to capture Zeus. The Titan's strength grows as Zeus' remaining godly powers are siphoned...and hell is unleashed on earth.\n\n\nWrath of the Titans encoded with handbrake for use with appletv. 1080p.
