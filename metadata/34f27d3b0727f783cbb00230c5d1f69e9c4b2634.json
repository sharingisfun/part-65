As Agnes' condition deteriorates and pain management becomes increasingly more difficult, fear and revulsion grip the sisters, who seem incapable of empathy, and Agnes' only comfort and solace comes from her maid Anna. As the end draws closer, long repressed feelings of grudging resentment and mistrust cause jealousy, selfishness, and bitterness between the siblings to surface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f27d3b0727f783cbb00230c5d1f69e9c4b2634","amp;dn":"Cries+and+Whispers+1972+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f27d3b0727f783cbb00230c5d1f69e9c4b2634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,242,125,59,7,39,247,131,203,176,2,48,197,209,246,158,156,75,38,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
