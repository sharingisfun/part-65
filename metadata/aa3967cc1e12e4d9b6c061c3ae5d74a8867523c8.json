The original torrent had over 1200 files made up of many pieces of .rar archives. It took a while to reassemble.  Additionally, I had to rename each file according to true episode name in order for it to scrape properly with XBMC media center. \n\nThis version is XBMC ready, just download and update your library, no assembly required!\n\nThanks to MAFIAA for the original work and up!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa3967cc1e12e4d9b6c061c3ae5d74a8867523c8","amp;dn":"Days+that+Shook+the+World+-+REPACK.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa3967cc1e12e4d9b6c061c3ae5d74a8867523c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,57,103,204,30,18,228,217,182,192,97,195,174,93,116,168,134,117,35,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
