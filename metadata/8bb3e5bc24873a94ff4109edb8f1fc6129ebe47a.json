Former Humble Pie guitarist Peter Frampton recorded a few perfectly fine albums with his band Frampton's Camel, but it wasn't until some of those tracks were recorded at a live performance in San Francisco and released as Frampton Comes Alive! that he became a household name. Buoyant pop, sentimental ballads, arena rock--this album has it all. The double-LP package set sales records and contained three bona fide radio hits--&quot;Baby, I Love Your Way,&quot; &quot;Show Me the Way,&quot; and &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do?&quot; This 25th-anniversary remastered package features three previously unreleased tracks from the source shows, plus an additional selection recorded at the time as a radio promo. --Lorry\nFleming\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Introduction - somethin's happening                  [05:56]\n02.Doobie wah                                           [05:43]\n03.Lines on my face                                     [07:00]\n04.Show me the way                                      [04:33]\n05.It's A plain shame                                   [04:04]\n06.Wind of change                                       [02:57]\n07.Just the time of the year previously unreleased      [04:22]\n08.Penny for your thoughts                              [01:35]\n09.All I want to be (is by your side)                   [03:08]\n10.Baby, I love your way                                [04:41]\n11.I wanna go to the sun                                [07:16]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.Nowhere's too far for my baby                        [04:49]\n     (previously unreleased)\n02.(i'll give you) money                                [05:47]\n03.Do you feel like we do                               [13:46]\n04.Shine on                                             [03:30]\n05.White sugar (previously unreleased)                  [04:44]\n06.Jumping jack flash                                   [07:41]\n07.Day's dawning (previously unreleased)                [03:35]\n____\n\n95:07 min\n148,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
