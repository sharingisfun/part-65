Supernovae represent the most violent stellar explosions in the universe. This is a unique guide to supernova facts, and it is also an observing/discovery guide, all in one package. Supernovae are often discovered by amateur astronomers, and the book describes the best strategies for discovering and observing them. Moreover, it contains detailed information about the probable physics of supernovae, a subject which even today is imperfectly understood.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 220 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (February 5, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0387352570\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0387352572","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e68caece78adaa830f54be7a2c321f968c8da1f","amp;dn":"Supernovae+and+How+to+Observe+Them%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e68caece78adaa830f54be7a2c321f968c8da1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,104,202,236,231,138,218,168,48,245,75,231,162,195,33,249,104,200,218,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
