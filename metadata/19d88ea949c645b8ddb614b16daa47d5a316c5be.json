However, the attack proves to be damaging for the Union as it suffers heavy losses. Shaw is wounded and loses consciousness. He is awakened by a black Union gravedigger named John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman), only to discover the battle still raging on nearby, and is sent to a field hospital. While receiving medical attention, Shaw is told that President Lincoln is on the verge of passing the Emancipation Proclamation, which will free slaves in the South. While on leave in Boston, Shaw visits his family, and his father has Shaw meet Frederick Douglass. Shaw is offered a promotion to the rank of Colonel, and command of the first all-black regiment ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He accepts the responsibility, and asks his childhood friend, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), to be his second-in-command. Their first volunteer soldier is another one of Shaw's friends, an educated black freeman named Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), who eagerly signs up.\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Glory 1989 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2440.84 MiB\nDuration: 2h 2mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 792 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-07-17 15:16:26\nSubtitles: English\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 115 r1995 c1e60b9\nAverage video bitrate: 2500kbps\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Glory 1080p x264 BluRay Thanks\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/49996609645187964468.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/49996609645187964468.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/68105683988942693984.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/68105683988942693984.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/14403822693661823982.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/14403822693661823982.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/61863176618589039204.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/61863176618589039204.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44477258781084705172.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44477258781084705172.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/41368249796362924475.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/41368249796362924475.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19d88ea949c645b8ddb614b16daa47d5a316c5be","amp;dn":"Glory+720p+BRRip+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19d88ea949c645b8ddb614b16daa47d5a316c5be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,216,142,169,73,198,69,184,221,182,20,177,109,170,71,213,163,22,197,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
