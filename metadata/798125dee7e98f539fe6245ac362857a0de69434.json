It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:798125dee7e98f539fe6245ac362857a0de69434","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+11+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"798125dee7e98f539fe6245ac362857a0de69434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,129,37,222,231,233,143,83,159,230,36,90,195,98,133,122,13,230,148,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
