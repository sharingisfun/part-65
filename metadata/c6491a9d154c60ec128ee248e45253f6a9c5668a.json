Has the P2P download work around files, as well as the 64-bit client exe for the beta. The game has been fully up to date as of 4/27/2012. The problems with the downloader and installer have been fixed and enhanced to work with all systems. NO INSTALL NEEDED! Just copy/move the folder wherever you want, and RUN THE LAUNCHER AS ADMINISTRATOR! Once the installer verifies the files, you can run the game (unless you have to wait for an update that was released after this time). If the game fails to launch, try running the 32-bit exe directly as administrator, 64 bit functionality is not guaranteed, as it is technically a beta feature in a beta (WoW was never meant to run with 64-bit, even the 64-bit stable Cataclysm client is still being tested).\n\nGOOD LUCK HAVE FUN!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6491a9d154c60ec128ee248e45253f6a9c5668a","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft%3A+Mists+of+Pandaria+Beta+%28updated+4%2F27%2F2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6491a9d154c60ec128ee248e45253f6a9c5668a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,73,26,157,21,76,96,236,18,142,226,72,228,82,83,246,169,197,102,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
