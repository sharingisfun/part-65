There exists video of him performing the folk ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLittle Log Cabin Round the LaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in a minstrel style. The footage was taken by the Fox Movietone News, in Powahatan, VA on November 8, 1928. Uncle John Scruggs played 5-string banjo in the traditional clawhammer style. There are no other known recordings of his music. Uncle John\\\\\\'s image is portrayed in the mural \\\\\\&quot;All in the Family II\\\\\\&quot;, which is on display at the Sherrod Library at East Tennessee State University. In the mural, Uncle John Scruggs is pictured in between Bill Monroe, \\\\\\&quot;the Father of bluegrass music\\\\\\&quot;, and Earl Scruggs, who popularized the 5-string banjo in the 20th century. The mural illustrates the important role that African-American musicians have played in the evolution of American music. The mural shows that racially diverse musicians are all members of the same family.\n       Whistler &amp; His Jug Band came up out of Louisville, Kentucky, and became the first recorded jug band, according to R Crumb\\\\\\'s Heroes of Blues, Jazz &amp; Country. They recorded at least twenty-one songs between 1924 and 1931. The names of the musicians remain unknown .A Jug band is a band employing a jug player and a mix of traditional and home-made instruments. These home-made instruments are ordinary objects adapted to or modified for making of sound, like the washtub bass, washboard, spoons, stovepipe and comb &amp; tissue paper (kazoo). Early jug bands were typically made up of African American vaudeville and medicine show musicians. Beginning in the urban south, they played a mixture of Memphis blues, ragtime, and jazz music. The history of jug bands is related to the development of the blues.The informal and energetic music of the jug bands also contributed to the development of rock and roll.\n        The Mound City Blue Blowers were an American jazz ensemble, active in the 1920s and 1930s, co-founded by Red McKenzie and Jack Bland. First assembled in 1923, the group\\\\\\'s original members were Red McKenzie playing comb and tissue paper, Dick Slevin on kazoo, and Jack Bland on banjo. The band also included, in lieu of a drum kit, a traveler\\\\\\'s suitcase played with foot and whisk brooms. Their debut recording, the 1924 release \\\\\\&quot;Arkansas Blues\\\\\\&quot; b/w \\\\\\&quot;Blue Blues\\\\\\&quot;, was a hit in the Midwest. They recorded twelve tunes in 1924 and 1925; Frankie Trumbauer and Eddie Lang played on some of the tracks.In 1929-1931 the group also made at least two short performance films: The Opry House (1929) and Nine O\\\\\\'Clock Folks (1931), which included \\\\\\&quot;I Ain\\\\\\'t Got Nobody\\\\\\&quot;,\\\\\\&quot;Let Me Call You Sweeheart,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;My Gal Sal\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;St. Louis Blues.\\\\\\&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(WORKING VERSION!)\n \n\n                        TOTAL LIST  (17.09.2011)\n\n\n          \n                       HISTORY OF POP AND ROCK MUSIC \n                        The Roots of Rock \\\\\\'n\\\\\\' Roll:  \n\n\n\n02.   Early Rural and Popular American Music (1920 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1935)  -  Skiffes and Jug Bands \n\n          Skiffle is a type of popular music with jazz, blues, folk, roots and country influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. They used instruments such as the washboard, jugs, tea chest bass, cigar-box fiddle, musical saw, and comb-and-paper kazoos, as well as more conventional instruments such as acoustic guitar and banjo. The first use of the term on record was in 1925 in the name of Jimmy O\\\\\\'Bryant and his Chicago Skifflers. Most often it was used to describe country blues music records, which included the compilation \\\\\\&quot;Hometown Skiffle\\\\\\&quot; (1929), and \\\\\\&quot;Skiffle Blues\\\\\\&quot; (1946) by Dan Burley &amp; His Skiffle Boys. It was used by Ma Rainey (1886ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1939) to describe her repertoire to rural audiences. The term skiffle disappeared from American music in the 1940s.\n           It became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was mainly associated with musician Lonnie Donegan and played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians.\n          A Jug band is a band employing a jug player and a mix of traditional and home-made instruments. These home-made instruments are ordinary objects adapted to or modified for making of sound, like the washtub bass, washboard, spoons, stovepipe and comb &amp; tissue paper (kazoo). The term jug band is loosely used in referring to ensembles that also incorporate home-made instruments but that are more accurately called skiffle bands, spasm bands or juke (or jook) bands (see juke joint) because they are missing the required jug player. Early jug bands were typically made up of African American vaudeville and medicine show musicians. Beginning in the urban south, they played a mixture of Memphis blues (even before it was formally called the blues), ragtime, and jazz music. The history of jug bands is related to the development of the blues. The informal and energetic music of the jug bands also contributed to the development of rock and roll.\n\n\n               UNCLE JOHN SCRUGGS  - Little Log Cabin Round the Lane  (1928)\n               WHISTLER &amp; HIS JUG BAND  -  Foldin\\\\\\' Bed   (1930)\n               MOUND CITY BLUE BLOWERS - St. Louis Blues  (1931)\n               WASHBOARD SERENADERS - unknow title  (1933)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:780442ca69457ef57ecca74c6fc333818ecdf640","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+318","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"780442ca69457ef57ecca74c6fc333818ecdf640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,4,66,202,105,69,126,245,126,204,167,76,111,195,51,129,142,205,246,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
