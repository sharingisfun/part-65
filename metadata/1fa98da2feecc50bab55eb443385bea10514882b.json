The documentary shows interviews with participants and voice re-enactments based on the actual court transcripts. The Dover trial was the first legal test of intelligent design as a scientific theory and is a landmark court case that set a precedent for all separation of church and state court cases to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa98da2feecc50bab55eb443385bea10514882b","amp;dn":"NOVA.Judgement.Day-Intelligent.Design.on.Trial.HDTV-MiRAGETV-CD2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa98da2feecc50bab55eb443385bea10514882b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,169,141,162,254,236,197,11,171,85,235,68,51,133,190,161,5,20,136,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
