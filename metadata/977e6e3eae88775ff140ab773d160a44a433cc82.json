But that's all in the past, part of a life half forgotten-a reality that vanished when he was attacked while camping and tossed aboard a starship bound for deep space.\n\nDesperately, Walker searches for explanations, only to realize he's trapped in a horrifying nightmare that is all too real. Instead of being a rich hotshot at the top of the food chain, Walker discovers he's just another amusing novelty, part of a cargo of Ã¢â‚¬Å“cuteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ aliens from primitive planets - destined to be sold as pets to highly advanced populations in Ã¢â‚¬Å“civilizedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ regions of the galaxy.\n\nEven if he weren't constantly watched by his captors, Walker has few options. After all, there is no escape from a speeding starship. Another man might resign himself to the inevitable and hope to be sold to a kindly owner, but not Walker. This former college football star has plenty of American ingenuity and no intention of admitting defeat, now or ever. In fact, he's only just begun to fight.\n\nRead by Oliver Wyman\n mp3 - 128kbps, 2 channel, 44.1 KHz\nPlay time: 10:31:27\n\n\n----------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n----------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977e6e3eae88775ff140ab773d160a44a433cc82","amp;dn":"Lost+and+Found+-+Alan+Dean+Foster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977e6e3eae88775ff140ab773d160a44a433cc82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,126,110,62,174,136,119,95,241,64,171,119,61,22,10,68,164,51,204,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
