I have had so many problems with Pando that I think this would help so many people to finally get a chance to play.\n\nInstructions:\nSimply open the download folder and run the file labeled \\&quot;setup.exe\\&quot; and you will run the installer.\n\nThere are no patches in this download, so post-installation you will have to run the installed program and let the patches download. This should run without problem. \n\nI\\'m not sure if this will run on European computers, but since you can change the server location in the patch download screen, I can\\'t see why it wouldn\\'t work.\n\nHope this helps everyone, and I will see you on the Field of Justice!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a20d525a1ffb466f9b352eee72f670350dd3120c","amp;dn":"League+of+Legends+NA+Install+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a20d525a1ffb466f9b352eee72f670350dd3120c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,13,82,90,31,251,70,111,155,53,46,238,114,246,112,53,13,211,18,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
