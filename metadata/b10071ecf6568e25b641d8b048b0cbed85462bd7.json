While the initial mystery has gone, the fascination continues, sustained by the close connection linking GRBs with some of the most fundamental topics in modern astrophysics and cosmology. Both authors have been active in GRB observations for over two decades and have produced an outstanding account on both the history and the perspectives of GRB research.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 624 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (April 7, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3540390855\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3540390855","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b10071ecf6568e25b641d8b048b0cbed85462bd7","amp;dn":"Gamma-Ray+Bursts%3AThe+brightest+explosions+in+the+Universe+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b10071ecf6568e25b641d8b048b0cbed85462bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,0,113,236,246,86,142,37,182,65,216,176,72,176,203,237,133,70,43,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
