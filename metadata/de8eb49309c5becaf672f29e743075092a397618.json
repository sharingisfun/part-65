Cass Seltzer, a university professor specializing in the psychology of religion, hits the big time with a bestselling book and an offer to teach at HarvardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½quite a step up from his current position at Frankfurter University. While waiting for his girlfriend to return from a conference, Cass receives an unexpected visit from Roz Margolis, whom he dated 20 years earlier and who looks as good now as she ever did. Her secret: dedicating her substantial smarts to unlocking the secrets of immortality. \n\nCass's recent success and Roz's sudden appearance send him into contemplation of the tumultuous events of his past, involving his former mentor, his failed first marriage and a young mathematical prodigy whose talent may go unrealized, culminating in a standing-room-only debate with a formidable opponent where Cass must reconcile his new, unfamiliar life with his experience of himself. Irreverent and witty, Goldstein seamlessly weaves philosophy into this lively and colorful chronicle of intellectual and emotional struggles.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de8eb49309c5becaf672f29e743075092a397618","amp;dn":"36+Arguments+for+the+Existence+of+God+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de8eb49309c5becaf672f29e743075092a397618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,142,180,147,9,197,190,202,246,114,242,158,116,48,117,9,42,57,118,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
