All the usual criticisms apply, but the setting is interesting, and the Deoxys is not your run-of-the-mill pokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon. I wouldn\\'t go so far to call this a good film, but I would say it\\'s perhaps the best of the pokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon films so far.\n\n\nQuite an excess of languages here. You get both Japanese and English audio, plus six included softsubs. Two English (Official DVD subtitles matching the english audio, or a more faithful fan translation), two Chinese (Traditional and Simplified) plus Italian and Spanish.\n\nDVDrip. Not HD. Quality looks very good though.\n1:39:39.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6b0e68ff9bb0cf4bc6133afb38c3ef8e6134b7","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Movie+7+-+Destiny+Deoxys+AKA+Sky-Splitting+Visitor+Deoxy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a6b0e68ff9bb0cf4bc6133afb38c3ef8e6134b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,107,14,104,255,155,176,207,75,198,19,58,251,56,195,239,142,97,52,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
