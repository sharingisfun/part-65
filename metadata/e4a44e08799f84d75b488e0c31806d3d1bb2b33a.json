Coverage includes human anatomy and physiology, diseases and their treatment, surgical and other medical procedures, broad topics (&quot;African American Health&quot; and similar surveys for American Indians and Asian Americans), and discussions of subjects such as &quot;Aging: Extended Care&quot; and &quot;Rape and Sexual Assault&quot; from medical perspectives. The authoritative articles are systematically organized and full of specific detail. A few also offer a sharp black-and-white photo or a labeled diagram. Complete tables of contents plus subject and relevant medical specialty indexes in each volume and helpful lists of symptoms and diseases and name and general indexes in volume six enhance accessibility. Back matter in the last volume also includes comprehensive annotated lists of organizations and websites. The sparse number of illustrations lends this set a utilitarian look. Like its predecessors, though, this is a solid source of reliable information and will also serve as a replacement for The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine (Gale, 1998).-John Peters, formerly at New York Public Library (c) Copyright 2010.
