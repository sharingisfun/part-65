Robert Christgau, the Dean of American\nRock Critics, called Hendrix's versions of &quot;Red House&quot; and, &quot;Johnny B.\nGoode&quot; on this album &quot;definitive.&quot; Out of print in the US since 1974 and for\nmore than two decades internationally, Hendrix In The West, has remained one\nof the most requested albums by fans to return to the commercial\nmarketplace.\n\nHendrix In The West will be reissued as an expanded single disc featuring\nfive additional, previously unavailable performances. The album's iconic\ncover features a classic Jim Marshall photograph of the guitarist and the\ntwenty-four page book is filled with rare and previously unseen images\ncaptured by Marshall's distinctive lens.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba53142a7607dccb5a0a6527da51db79078c4bd2","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Hendrix+In+The+West+-+2011+-+MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba53142a7607dccb5a0a6527da51db79078c4bd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,83,20,42,118,7,220,203,90,10,101,39,218,81,219,121,7,140,75,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
