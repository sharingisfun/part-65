Griffiths monumental epic as one of the greatest movies ever committed to celluloid. Griffith powerfully interlaces four parallel tales linked by a recurring shot of Lillian Gish symbolically rocking the cradle of civilization. The stories, which span two millennia, collectively illustrate how intolerance has played a pernicious role in such historic events as Christs crucifixion and the fall of Babylon.\n\n*** \nI upload my torrents to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid, if you would like to upload one of my torrent files to another tracker feel free. \nAll I ask is that you upload the same torrent file you downloaded by clicking on one of my links so that more seeders/peers are in the swarm.  \n***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31b488b2a3f4c340884edeca79aa9c2fb8c58e0","amp;dn":"Intolerance+%281916%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31b488b2a3f4c340884edeca79aa9c2fb8c58e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,27,72,139,42,63,76,52,8,132,237,236,167,154,169,194,251,140,88,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
