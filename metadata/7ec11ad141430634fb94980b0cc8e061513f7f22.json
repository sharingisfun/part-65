But if his approach to his instrument was constant, his approach to jazz was dazzlingly protean. To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-40s to the early 90s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period, and he often led the way in those changes, both with his own performances and recordings and by choosing sidemen and collaborators who forged new directions. It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasnt there to push it forward. \n \nArtist: Miles Davis\nAlbum: The Real...Miles Davis\nReleased: 2011\nSource: 3CD Box Set\nGenre: Jazz \nStyle: Cool\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44100 Hz\nBitrate: ~860 KBps\nCovers: Front\n \nTracks:\n \nCD 1 \n \n 1.
