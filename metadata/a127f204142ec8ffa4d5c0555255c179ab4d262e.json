They were there to have their treasures appraised and potentially bought by our team of pawn masters.\n\nWho are the Pawn Masters? Howard Green, Douglas Stocks, John Kantymir, Fiona Kenny, and Mark Bradac. On hand to meet the hopeful sellers was a team of expert appraisers with keen eyes and years of experience amongst them. Their job was simple: to separate what was worth cash from what was simply trash. Coveted items were put before the pawn masters, five expert collectors with money in hand, who were ready to pounce on items they liked and spend their own cash to buy them!\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss how much these items went for and which gems had the pawn masters fighting each other in a full blown bidding war. \n\n\n\n\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name        : pawnathon.canada.s01e01.hdtv.x264-cldd.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 071 Kbps\nLength            : 337 MiB for 43mn 59s 680ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 902 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 400 (1.800) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 165 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a127f204142ec8ffa4d5c0555255c179ab4d262e","amp;dn":"Pawnathon+Canada+-+Season+1+%282011%29+HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a127f204142ec8ffa4d5c0555255c179ab4d262e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,39,242,4,20,46,200,255,164,213,192,85,82,85,193,121,171,77,38,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
