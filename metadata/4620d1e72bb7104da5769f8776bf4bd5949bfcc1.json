And what a result he achieved! 50 percent of 'Sound Surfers' consists of tracks produced by Russian artists, both uprising like Artsence, Lyric and Neospherix as well as already established stars like Fungus Funk himself and a remake of 'Letite' from RadioTrance. For the remix Ultrarech teamed up with magnificent Miss YoYo and together they put a fresh breath into this legendary anthem. The international psytrance scene is represented here by such masters as Alternative Control, M-Klome and Neuromotor. Also promising new producers from South Africa, Shockwave and Zezia appear here with their debut international releases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4620d1e72bb7104da5769f8776bf4bd5949bfcc1","amp;dn":"VA+-+Sound+Surfers+-+2011+%5BPsychedelic+Trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4620d1e72bb7104da5769f8776bf4bd5949bfcc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,32,209,231,43,183,16,77,165,118,159,135,118,191,75,213,148,155,252,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
