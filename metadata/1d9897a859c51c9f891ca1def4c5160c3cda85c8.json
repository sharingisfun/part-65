This really rocks, but the downside is that the songs are quite short... almost like the Anal Cunt of chiptune. The short track length works in the sense that it keeps the listener wanting more, and the rapid succession definitely keeps things interesting. If you're looking to hear some bizarre tunage, this will certainly do the trick! 7/10\n\n Freely available here: http://zoom-on-a-kill.bandcamp.com/album/i-was-her","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d9897a859c51c9f891ca1def4c5160c3cda85c8","amp;dn":"Zoom+On+A+Kill+-+I+Was+Her+%5B2011.V0.MP3.WEB%5D+HoTT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d9897a859c51c9f891ca1def4c5160c3cda85c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,152,151,168,89,197,28,159,137,28,161,222,244,197,22,12,60,218,133,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
