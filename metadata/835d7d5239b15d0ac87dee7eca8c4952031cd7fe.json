When asked for registration, use the details provided. Block with Little Snitch to prevent serial verification! Done! Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Description:\n\nStart recording your income and expenses right now, be it a coffee during lunch break or a brand new car - finally, you'll get a clear overview of what exactly you spend your money for. Categories are there to help you distinguish costs for food from recurring expenditures for rent and insurances. Visualize your cash flow so you might track down areas that allow you to save money.\n\nOf course, iFinance will import your existing financial data in CSV, QIF, OFX and MT940 formats. That way, your digital bank statement is integrated just as easily as the data from your previous financing software. In addition to that, iFinance mobile, available for your iPhone or iPod touch from Apple's iTunes AppStore, allows you to add spendings to your list right when and where they occur.\n\nAdd as many files to a specific transaction as you like. This way you can attach receipts or invoices as picture, text or pdf file to your entries in order to access the reference file whenever and wherever you want. Media files are being synchronized with iFinance Mobile (version 2.1 and higher). Add or browse your media files on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad (and of course on your Mac!).\n\niFinance has been translated into a total of 11 languages. This means that the entire user interface, including all buttons, labels and menu entries, automatically adapts to the language settings in your Mac's System Preferences. Currently, the following languages are available: English, German, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Czech, Spanish, Chinese, and Polish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:835d7d5239b15d0ac87dee7eca8c4952031cd7fe","amp;dn":"Synium+iFinance+3.3.7+%5BMacOSX%5D+%2B+Serials.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"835d7d5239b15d0ac87dee7eca8c4952031cd7fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,93,125,82,57,177,93,10,200,125,238,126,202,140,73,82,3,28,215,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
