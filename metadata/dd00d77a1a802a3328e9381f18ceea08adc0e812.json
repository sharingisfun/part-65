It was like nothing he had heard before, and a perfect match for his style of expression. A year later, after producing nearly 20 dubstep tracks exclusively released to his YouTube Channel, Ry released Buzz Lightyear. The song gained a massive viral internet response within a year, gathering millions combined listens. RyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influential mix of listening gangster rap, hardcore metal, classical masterpieces, and timeless film scores have all lead to RyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style, allowing him to produce unique music that has been signed to multiple labels and distributed for worldwide consumption.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd00d77a1a802a3328e9381f18ceea08adc0e812","amp;dn":"Ry+Legit+-+The+Superman+LP+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd00d77a1a802a3328e9381f18ceea08adc0e812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,0,215,122,26,128,42,51,40,233,56,31,24,206,234,8,173,192,232,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
