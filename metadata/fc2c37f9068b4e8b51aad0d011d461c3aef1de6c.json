Eager to separate fact from fiction, British writer and explorer, Piers Gibbon ventures into some of the remotest areas of this hugely diverse nation, where he comes face to face with an array of remarkable individuals. With no electricity or running water and a three day trek to the nearest telephone, the traditional tribal way of life has remained largely untouched - but the big question is, has cannibalism made it into the 21st century? In his search for an answer, Piers finds himself chatting with locals who are surprisingly candid about their cannibal past. With no apparent taboo over the issue, he is able to gather first-hand accounts of the killing and eating of fellow human beings suspected of being witches. Piers also encounters an ageing missionary who has lived among the villagers for nearly 40 years, and can recall a time when cannibalism was commonplace. But does it still go on today?\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2040 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16.9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 700 MB\nRipped by: Harry65\nSource: DVB-rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc2c37f9068b4e8b51aad0d011d461c3aef1de6c","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Cannibal.Island.PDTV.XviD.MP3.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc2c37f9068b4e8b51aad0d011d461c3aef1de6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,44,55,249,6,139,78,139,81,170,208,208,17,212,97,195,174,241,222,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
