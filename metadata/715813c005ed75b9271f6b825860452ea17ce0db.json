But it is all in a dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work for the great detective, who continues to defy the odds and lives to fiddle and ratiocinate another day.\n\nHere is another Thomas and Telfer audio book again divided into one mp3 for each story. Sadly I don't even think the CD set is out in the UK, for me to rip for Demonoid, but I've grabbed this 2 part download version and edited it (without decoding) into story mp3s. You would think that the place from where this originates (need I say the name - oh by the way I've also removed the 'this is audible' guff at the start and end) could at least do the editing themselves. No wonder we don't all shop there (and no wonder people turn to torrents!)\n\nFile list:\n01 The Case of the Tell Tale Hands.mp3\n02 The Case of the King's Evil.mp3\n03 The Case of the Portugese Sonnets.mp3\n04 The Case of Peter the Painter.mp3\n05 The Case of the Zimmerman Telegram.mp3\n\nHere's some Media Info info for one of the files:\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nDuration : 1h 41mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 70.1 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 51.0 MiB (100%)\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:715813c005ed75b9271f6b825860452ea17ce0db","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+and+the+King%5C%27s+Evil+-+Donald+Thomas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"715813c005ed75b9271f6b825860452ea17ce0db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,88,19,192,5,237,117,185,39,31,107,130,88,96,69,46,161,124,224,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
