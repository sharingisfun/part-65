Her husband, a plastic surgeon, has evolved from a yeti-like creature to accommodate her masochism with increasingly extreme and bizarre rituals. With an experimental and ground-breaking format, The Three Trials incorporates surreal narrative, music video, and abstract imagery. The viewer is left to interpret what is real, what is dream, and what is false narrative in this feverish, pitch-black comedy with a smorgasbord of sexual fetishes.\n\n268 Mb, 320x240, FLV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:631d18c8ea7718dde454b85a7657fe9bd043ae4f","amp;dn":"The+Three+Trials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"631d18c8ea7718dde454b85a7657fe9bd043ae4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,29,24,200,234,119,24,221,228,84,184,90,118,87,254,155,208,67,174,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
