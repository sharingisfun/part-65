The Another One for Woody benefit show took place at New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Roseland BallroomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the same venue that hosted the original One for Woody benefit a decade agoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and raised money for music education in public schools. The performance stretched until nearly 2 AM.\n\nThe Another One for Woody benefit was divided into three mini-segments that brought together members of the three groups with whom Woody is most regularly associated: The Allman Brothers Band, GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule and Artimus Pyle Band. Before the eveningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first segment, Haynes and his longtime friends McCain and Kevn Kinney (DrivinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ N CryinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) welcomed the audience with acoustic versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust Outside Of Heaven (A Good Country Mile),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Lucky OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Shall Be Released.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nGuitarist Luther Dickinson and drummer CodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who performed under the name the North Mississippi Allstars DuoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½hosted the nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first set of music. Near the start of the set, Luther Dickinson told the crowd that GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule took the fledging Allstars out as a duo in 1998 and Woody would play bass with the band each night. The Dickinsons ran through self-described ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œraw and unrehearsedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSitting On Top Of The World,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShimmy She Wobble,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStation Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreachinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGlory GloryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ before bringing out Big Sugar guitaristÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and recent GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule producerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Gordie Johnson for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPo Black MaddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStraight To Hell.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The North Mississippi Allstars Duo brought its set to a close by inviting out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s-era Lynyrd Skynyrd drummer Artimus Pyle, GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule keyboardist Danny Louis and former Black Crowes guitarist Audley Freed for a set-closing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhiskey Rockin RollaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (three Black Crowes guitarists participated in the benefit at various points in the night).\n\nGovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t MuleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s project at the time of his passingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½hosted the second and most personal segment of the evening. Before the band took the stage, HaynesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ longtime guitar technician Brian Farmer placed a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMule CrossingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sign on an amplifier near the front of the stage and images culled from throughout MuleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career were projected behind the group throughout its set. The current incarnation of GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule opened its performance with takes on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRailroad Boy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlind Man In The Dark,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSteppinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ LightlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBanks Of The Deep End.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HaynesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ most direct lyrical tribute to Woody took place at the end of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBanks,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ when he stretched out the final ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlost my best friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ line of the song.\n\nThe parade of guests truly started during ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m A Ram,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as Johnson returned to the stage with moe. percussionists Jim Loughlin and Vinnie Amico. Haynes remarked that most of the music and musicians featured at the benefit have a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshared historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the fallen bassist: GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule shared many early bills with Big Sugar and also with moe. in the late ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“90s as part of the Summer Sessions tour. After ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m A Ram,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ moe. guitarist Chuck Garvey replaced Johnson for a take on the BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDear Prudence.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAs the night moved on, the set started to resemble more of an all-star jam than a traditional Mule set. The Dickinson Brothers, Pyle and harmonica player Hook HerreraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who played at the very first Mule showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½sat in on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ32/20 Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while Pyle and Black Crowes guitarist Rich Robinson helped the members of Mule with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStay With Me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNext, Haynes, Louis and Mule drummer Matt Abts were joined by Robinson, Pyle and current Lynyrd Skynyrd bassist Robert Kearns for a take on the Crowes hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSometimes SalvationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and after Abts and Robinson left the stage, the Skynyrd standard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSimple Man.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HaynesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who played with Kearns long before the bassist joined SkynyrdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½noted that he had two members of the veteran southern rock onstage, though the bassist joined Lynyrd Skynyrd nearly 18 years after Pyle left the group. The members of GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule later returned to the stage with Freed for their own ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWishing WellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nGovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t MuleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s set closed with a deeply personal moment as WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 13-year-old daughter Savannah Woody took the stage with her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band for the first time. The younger Woody sang with GovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mule and Pyle on HaynesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ signature song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoulshine.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Haynes handed Savannah the appropriate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthink back to what my daddy saidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Pyle brought her a tambourine to shake during the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s breakdown.\n\nAfter a short break, the Allman Brothers Band took the stage for eveningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third and final segment. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who already clocked in a busy day that included a press conference on the ABBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2011 Beacon Theater residencyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½took the stage close to 11 PM and charged into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Want You No More,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Not My Cross To Bear,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEnd of the Line,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo One To Run With,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack Hearted Woman,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Been TalkingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMidnight Rider.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The group then opened its show to guests during ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne Way OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Robinson returning to the stage, Pyle sitting in for Jaimoe and Berry Oakley Jr replacing bassist Oteil Burbridge. Oakley, whose father and namesake was the ABBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s founding bassist, also remained onstage for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStatesboro Blues.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThough no members of the Grateful Dead sat in during the show, as had been heavily rumored, the Allman Brothers Band did pay back-to-back tributes to two of its Summer Jam at Watkins Glenn co-headliners. First, the Allman Brothers Band covered The BandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe WeightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Louis on keyboards and Freed on auxiliary guitar. Then moe.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Garvey, Loughlin and Amico returned to the stage for a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ jam that bled into the Grateful DeadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFranklinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tower.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The members of the Allman Brothers Band brought back the Dickinson Brothers and Herrera for a set-closing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSouthboundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ jam and closed its set sans guests with the lone encore of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhipping Post.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe night came to a close around 2 AM with a surprise second encore of Pink FloydÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWish You Were HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that featured Haynes, Oakley, Johnson, Louis and Abts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1925f56b56380b9cca5419f6f06898e03ed05bf8","amp;dn":"Another+One+For+Woody+11-22-2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1925f56b56380b9cca5419f6f06898e03ed05bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,37,245,107,86,56,11,156,202,84,25,246,240,104,152,224,62,208,91,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
