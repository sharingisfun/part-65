It blended tongue in cheek humour with action and adventure for an end result that was extremely entertaining. Unfortunately, all good things cannot last. The first season (when it was still shot in black and white) and the second season (the first one shot in colour) place The Man From U.N.C.L.E. among the best television has to offer. All of this changed with the third season, when the series became so silly that watching its episodes became nearly unbearable. The show recovered somewhat in its abbreviated fourth season (it would be cancelled midway through), but by that time The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had lost its charm. Though the fourth season episodes are watchable, they lack the humor and panache of the first two seasons. Regardless, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is a testament to what Sixties television could do at its very finest.\n\nTrivia\n\nThere is quite a bit of trivia on this series that i find interesting anyways on imdb\n\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8af2d0cd29edf00fa2e7b232dfd0cfd144569d4","amp;dn":"Man+from+U.N.C.L.E.+season+02+eps.+11+-+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8af2d0cd29edf00fa2e7b232dfd0cfd144569d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,175,45,12,210,158,223,0,250,46,123,35,45,253,12,253,20,69,105,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
