While he spends his days drunk, his kids learn to take care of themselves.\n \nThe show's producers sought to distinguish it from previous American working-class shows by highlighting how Frank's alcoholism affects his family.[6] Paul Abbott, creator of the original, said, &quot;It's not My Name Is Earl or Roseanne. It's got a much graver level of poverty attached to it. It's not blue collar; it's no collar.&quot;[6] When John Wells, the showrunner, began pitching the show, he had to fight efforts to place the show in the South or in a trailer park. He explained, &quot;We have a comedic tradition of making fun of the people in those worlds. The reality is that these people aren't 'the other' Ã¢â‚¬â€ they're people who live four blocks down from you and two blocks over&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d175c024da78302990b7ba754d8366458fb790","amp;dn":"Shameless.US.S01.and.S02.720p.HDTVRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d175c024da78302990b7ba754d8366458fb790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,209,117,192,36,218,120,48,41,144,183,186,117,77,131,102,69,143,183,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
