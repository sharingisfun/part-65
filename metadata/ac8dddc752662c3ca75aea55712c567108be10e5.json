It is the story of 35-year-old Mike (Matthew Perry) who becomes a 17-year-old high school student (Zac Efron) after a chance accident. The film was released in the United States on April 17, 2009. It was set in 2007 (it was originally supposed to be released in 2008, but was delayed until the following year), as evidenced by the date on the cell phones of several students (during a scene where Efron is beaten up by the school bully), and also by the age of Mike and Scarlett's eldest child, Maggie (she's a 17 or 18 year old high school senior)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac8dddc752662c3ca75aea55712c567108be10e5","amp;dn":"17+Again+%282009%29+-+BRRip+720p+-+PrinceNahin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac8dddc752662c3ca75aea55712c567108be10e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,141,221,199,82,102,44,60,167,90,234,85,113,44,86,113,8,190,16,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
