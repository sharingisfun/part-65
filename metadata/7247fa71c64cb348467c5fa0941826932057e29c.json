Therefore, recording the first track on this album was made only in July 2010 with producer Dapo Torimiro.\n\nThat same month, the singer gave an interview to MTV, in which she said she was \\\\\\&quot;creating a new sound,\\\\\\&quot; it would be \\\\\\&quot;fun. A little more R&amp;B/pop.\\\\\\&quot;Later, in conversation with AHN, quoted Rihanna and Keri Hilson as influences.At the time, she revealed she planned to work in no hurry on this album, stating that \\\\\\&quot;Every other album I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t had time to really take my time and craft it like I really wanted to do because I was finding spare time between a television show, and movies, and touring, and then all over again. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve worked on (the album) for the past year and really gone hard over the past few months, but you can definitely tell that I took my time with this record.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nIn August 2010, Demi entered in the Camp Rock World Tour 2010 to release the movie Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. In November, she left the tour due to personal problems and was admitted to a clinic for three months.

Later that month, was announced that she would leave Sonny with a Chance, in which she portrayed Sonny Munroe, the main character. She left the show because she wanted to focus on her music career more than acting.\n\nIn July 2011, Demi described the album as \\\\\\&quot;more mature\\\\\\&quot; than their previous sound and more fun and light than her first single, \\\\\\&quot;Skyscraper\\\\\\&quot;, while other tracks are more intense. On August 11th, 2011, Demi used her Twitter account and Facebook page to announce the title of her album (Unbroken).\n\nIn August 2011, Lovato explained the song \\\\\\&quot;All Night Long\\\\\\&quot; which features Missy Elliott and Timbaland is actually the polar opposite of \\\\\\&quot;Skyscraper\\\\\\&quot; and said it is about \\\\\\&quot;staying up all night long and singing it to the boy that you like, and it\\\\\\'s flirty and fun and it\\\\\\'s not too grown-up, but it\\\\\\'s grown-up enough.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nDemi Lovato wasn\\\\\\'t kidding when she teased some star-studded collaborations for her comeback album Unbroken. On Tuesday, the Disney star revealed on her website that her upcoming set will include musical pairings with Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Jason DerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼lo, Dev and Iyaz.\nWhile Lovato\\\\\\'s power-ballad lead single \\\\\\&quot;Skyscraper\\\\\\&quot; nabs a place toward the end of Unbroken, all of her studio team-ups appear at the beginning of the 15-song lineup.
