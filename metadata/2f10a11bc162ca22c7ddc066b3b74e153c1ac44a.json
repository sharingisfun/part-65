Of course I wasn't sure if anyone would be interested in downloading any of it, but it was still indeed something that I had prayed on before doing.  By the end of that year, I had grouped together 32 different 2+ gig bundles which accounted for 837 Christian releases.  It was my goal to reach 1,000 releases in 2011, but I fell short of that perhaps because of my late start.\n\nToday, I'm currently sharing my 21st bundle of &quot;2012 - The Year In Christian Music.&quot;  Combined, all 21 bundles account for 558 Christian Music releases at some point in time year.  I pray that the Lord is leading you in doing your part to share the message in this music as well, as He has me.\n\nThe 27 titles in this 21st bundle today include...\n\n * Andy Tallman - 2012 - Hope Rise\n * Beautiful Eulogy - 2012 - Satellite Kite\n * Bellarive - 2012 - The Heartbeat\n * Big Fil - 2012 - Stadium Status\n * Bonafide Praisers - 2012 - Liberated\n * Brandi Carlile - 2012 - Live At Bear Creek EP\n * Brett Younker - 2012 - Come To The Water\n * Burner, The - 2012 - Redemption EP\n * Canopy Red - 2012 - Wake Up\n * Chris Lee Cobbins - 2012 - Breathe Again - Single\n * Chuck Hooten - 2012 - Home\n * Coko - 2012 - Always Coko\n * Everyday Sunday - 2012 - Calculate - Single\n * Holy Hot Boyz - 2012 - Acts 1? ?8 Jerusalem\n * Jonathan Seller - 2012 - Great Exchange\n * Katy Hudson - 2012 - Katy Hudson\n * Kerrie Roberts - 2012 - Finally Home - Single\n * Miseration - 2012 - Tragedy Has Spoken\n * Our Hearts Hero - 2012 - Shine On\n * Phao - 2012 - Playing With Fire\n * Richard Marx - 2012 - Inside My Head\n * Sara Groves - 2012 - Invisible Empires - Acoustic EP\n * Sound Doctrine - 2012 - The Sound-Off\n * Sunrise, The - 2012 - We Have Not Heard\n * Tenth Avenue North - 2012 - Losing - Single\n * Victizzle - 2012 - Misfit EP\n * Welcome Wagon, The - 2012 - Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - June 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f10a11bc162ca22c7ddc066b3b74e153c1ac44a","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+21+of+21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f10a11bc162ca22c7ddc066b3b74e153c1ac44a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,16,161,27,193,98,202,34,199,221,192,102,179,183,78,21,60,26,196,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
