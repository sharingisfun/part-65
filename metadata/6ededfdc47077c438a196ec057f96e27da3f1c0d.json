Indeed, this minigame collection with a grimy coating of gross-out humor, gleeful sadomasochism, and calculated bad decisions would've felt much more essential had it been released nearer to the run of the show or the theatrical release of one of the Jackass movies. It might feel a little mercenary, and the minigames don't break any new ground, but for those who have maintained a fondness for that special blend of shopping carts, hilarious underwear choices, and vomit, Jackass: The Game does a good job of capturing the spirit of the show.\n\nEPISODE 2 FIXED!!\n\nCSO - 1.60 GB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ededfdc47077c438a196ec057f96e27da3f1c0d","amp;dn":"Jackass+the+Game+-+PSP+%28+Episode+2+fixed+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ededfdc47077c438a196ec057f96e27da3f1c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,222,223,220,71,7,124,67,138,25,110,192,87,249,110,39,218,63,28,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
