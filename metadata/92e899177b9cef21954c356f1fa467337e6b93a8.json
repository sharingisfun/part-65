The book is very child friendly, and can be read by all ages. This series details the antics of Spirou as an elementary schoolboy. A lot of the gags center around the character's interest in the opposite sex, most notably he and his pals coming up with ways of spying on the girls' showers and dressing room. Other topics concern religion and the contradictions and absurdities of the adult world. It is generally acknowledged that, psychologically speaking, the character in Little Spirou has little in common with the clean-cut adult he will become.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e899177b9cef21954c356f1fa467337e6b93a8","amp;dn":"Little+Spirou+01+-+Say+Hello+to+the+Nice+Lady","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e899177b9cef21954c356f1fa467337e6b93a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,232,153,23,123,156,239,33,149,76,53,111,31,164,103,51,126,107,147,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
