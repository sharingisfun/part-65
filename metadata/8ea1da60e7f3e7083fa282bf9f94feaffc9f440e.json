This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 4- Friday - Gary kicks off the MasterClass with mouth-watering barbecue chicken and is later joined by special guest chef Jason Jones who teaches the contestants how to serve up the perfect Mexican feast. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ea1da60e7f3e7083fa282bf9f94feaffc9f440e","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E24.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ea1da60e7f3e7083fa282bf9f94feaffc9f440e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,161,218,96,231,243,231,8,63,162,130,191,159,148,254,175,252,159,68,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
