Thanks to both for a dam nice game.\nThis is a VERY funny game, and don't even need to be installed. (But unrar it first.)\nPut this exremly tiny file in a DIRECTORY wherever you like and doubleclick on it, and play. It will make a hiscore-file (1 kb) and that's all.\nIt is very small, and no install need. PERFECT simply. Run it whenever you got some spare time to kill. If you need a break, just press WINDOW-button.\nI have been playing this tiny game sometimes for about 15 year, and about now I think I can say I know it. It's nothing you learn in one day.\n\n---\n\nThe other one, Pirates Quest made by First Star Software, Inc, is even better, bu shorter.\n\n...\n\nEnjoy the games!\ninto","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af322d4dbfcf1cbb5b6fe70c47fd7eb6c45b292","amp;dn":"Boulder+Dash+2+pcs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af322d4dbfcf1cbb5b6fe70c47fd7eb6c45b292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,243,34,212,219,252,241,203,181,182,254,112,196,127,215,235,108,69,178,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
