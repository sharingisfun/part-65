It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dea299c5b452d673733870e7065496422659848f","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+11+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dea299c5b452d673733870e7065496422659848f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,162,153,197,180,82,214,115,115,56,112,231,6,84,150,66,38,89,132,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
