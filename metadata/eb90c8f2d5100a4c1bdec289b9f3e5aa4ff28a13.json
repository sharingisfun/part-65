This is current as of 'Dexter is delicious' \n\nThere are 6 files in this torrent they are listed below (random order):\n\ndearly_devoted_dexter.epub\ndexter_by_design.epub\ndarkly_dreaming_dexter.epub\ndexter_is_delicious.rpub\nreadme.txt\ndexter_in_the_dark.epub\n\nAll these epub books are retail copies, so they will work on all eReaders that support ePub docs as well as iDevices (4.3.3 and up)\n\nI really enjoyed these books, and I am a big fan of Jeff Lindsay's writing style. If you've watched all the TV series you should still read these because, as always there is more in the books then you see in the show!\n\nThanks for seeding!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb90c8f2d5100a4c1bdec289b9f3e5aa4ff28a13","amp;dn":"Jeff+Lindsay+-+Dexter+Series+%5BComplete+2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb90c8f2d5100a4c1bdec289b9f3e5aa4ff28a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,144,200,242,213,16,10,76,27,222,194,137,185,243,229,170,79,242,138,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
