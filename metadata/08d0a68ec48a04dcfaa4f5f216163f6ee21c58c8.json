It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d0a68ec48a04dcfaa4f5f216163f6ee21c58c8","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+13+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d0a68ec48a04dcfaa4f5f216163f6ee21c58c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,208,166,142,196,138,4,220,250,164,245,242,22,22,63,110,226,28,88,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
