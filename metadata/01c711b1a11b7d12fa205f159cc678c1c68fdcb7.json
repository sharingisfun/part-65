The great Python language comes in 2 versions (2.7 and 3.1) and we also include Subversion and the very popular Git as version control systems. This could make PapugLinux a great bundle to start to learn Python or symply browse the open-source projects all over the world.\nThe live running-mode uses new tools and another compression format, this results in more content in a smaller size.\nThe desktop image credit goes to Flavio Takemoto from Brasil, this artist has a great portfolio of artwork.\nKindest regards,\n-sb\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.papuglinux.net/Overview/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.papuglinux.net/Overview/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : 88f2e3c0de9cfb67fe6b3ea28b51854c  papuglinux-11.1.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c711b1a11b7d12fa205f159cc678c1c68fdcb7","amp;dn":"papuglinux-11.1.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c711b1a11b7d12fa205f159cc678c1c68fdcb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,199,17,177,161,27,125,18,250,32,95,21,156,198,120,193,198,143,220,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
