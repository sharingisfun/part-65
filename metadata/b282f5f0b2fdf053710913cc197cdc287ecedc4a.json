When one argument too many leads to probation, Captain Phil Sutton takes a novel approach to try and save their flagging partnership: he sends Travis and Wes to couples counseling.\n\nWhile Travis and Wes certainly do have their issues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Travis bounced from foster home to foster home as a child, and Wes hasn't quite accepted the fact that his decision to join the police force caused his ex-wife Alex to divorce him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they aren't exactly receptive to the methods of their new therapist, Dr. Emma Ryan. However, Captain Sutton makes it clear that the only way they're going to keep their jobs is if they stick with the counseling and learn to work together.\n\nBut when the high profile murder of a Senator's son lands in their laps, Travis and Wes soon learn that juggling casework with therapy isn't easy. And as the details of the case take them from Skid Row to Beverly Hills, the tension between the two detectives surges towards a boiling point until it finally explodes at the worst possible time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in front of the D.A.\n\nSuspended, Travis and Wes realise that if they want to solve the case and keep their jobs, they just may have to have to ignore their differences and give this therapy thing a real shot.\n\n\n\nNOT IN THIS EPISODE\n\nIf you are looking for Amy Acker or were into this series BECAUSE of her then sorry but the folks who make the decisions decided to drop her in favour of Sonya Walger whom you might know from The Mind Of The Married Man or maybe from Sleeper Cell. Don't you just hate when roles get recast and you would like BOTH people to be in the show.  \n\n\n\nThe file specs are pretty standard:\n\n67min 51sec\ncirca 549 MB\n624x352 px\nXviD\nVirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3 - no longer using packed bitstream \n128kbps vbr mp3\nsourced from that mecca from whence the WEB-DL was born.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b282f5f0b2fdf053710913cc197cdc287ecedc4a","amp;dn":"Common.Law.s01e01.WEB-DL.XviD-jAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b282f5f0b2fdf053710913cc197cdc287ecedc4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,130,245,240,178,253,240,83,113,9,19,204,25,124,220,40,126,206,220,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
