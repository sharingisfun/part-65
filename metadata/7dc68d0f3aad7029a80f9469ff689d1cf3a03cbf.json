He soon becomes the laughing stock of the herd because of his jumbo-sized ears and is cruelly nicknamed &quot;Dumbo&quot;. When Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper, she is locked up as a mad elephant and Dumbo finds himself all alone, except for a self-appointed mentor-protector, Timothy Q. Mouse. After Dumbo and Timothy meet a group of crows, they convince Dumbo that he might be able to fly with a boost of confidence. With his &quot;magic feather,&quot; Dumbo takes flight. When he loses his feather, Dumbo realises that he could fly by himself the entire time. After performing for the circus, Dumbo is a media sensation with Timothy as his manager and his mother by his side.\n\n\nDVD Special Features\n\nDeleted Scenes\nDeleted Scene: The Mouse's Tale\nDeleted Song: &quot;Are You a Man or a Mouse&quot;\n\nBackstage Disney\nTaking Flight: The Making of Dumbo\nMagic of Dumbo: Ride of Passage Sound Design Excerpt from &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;\n\nOriginal Walt Disney Television Introduction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc68d0f3aad7029a80f9469ff689d1cf3a03cbf","amp;dn":"Walt+Disneys-Dumbo%5B70th+Anniv+Edition%5D-+Full+rip%5Dby+winker%40T.F.R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc68d0f3aad7029a80f9469ff689d1cf3a03cbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,198,141,15,58,173,112,41,168,15,148,105,255,104,157,28,243,160,60,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
