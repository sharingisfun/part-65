The movie stars Ryan Gosling as Stephen Meyers, an idealistic deputy campaign manager for Governor Mike Morris (Clooney), who is in a major political battle in Ohio that could be the key to winning the Democratic presidential nomination. When the opposing candidate's campaign manager (Paul Giamatti) offers Stephen a job on his staff, Stephen neglects to inform his boss (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Just as that omission is revealed, Stephen uncovers a dirty personal secret that could sink Morris' political career. The Ides of March screened at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nRipped with Autogk\n\nLength: 1 Hour 41 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 592\n\nFrame Height: 256\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 109kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c03c804126fb365f34edd79fb94ae6e3a66b2f","amp;dn":"Ides+of+March%282011%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c03c804126fb365f34edd79fb94ae6e3a66b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,192,60,128,65,38,251,54,95,52,237,215,159,185,74,230,227,166,107,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
