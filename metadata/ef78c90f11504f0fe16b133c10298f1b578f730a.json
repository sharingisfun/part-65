Son of a Mexican father and Anglo mother, Urrea grew up first in Tijuana and then just across the border in San Diego. Over the years he has produced a series of acclaimed novels, including [i]The HummingbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daughter[/i], [i]The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Highway[/i], and his latest, [i]Queen of America[/i] Ã¢â‚¬â€ each a rich and revealing account of the people of the borderlands that join and separate our two nations.\n\nEarlier this year, a number of books were removed from Tucson, Arizona classrooms when the Tucson school district eliminated a Mexican-American studies program on the accusation it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“divisive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The program included references to UrreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work. Urrea talks with Bill Moyers about that episode as he unfolds the modern reality of life on the border.\n\nEpisode webpage:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-between-two-worlds-life-on-the-border/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-between-two-worlds-life-on-the-border/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----\n\nType: mp4 file\nSize: 284MB\nRuntime: 00:56:46\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x360\nAudio: AAC 44100Hz stereo 108Kbps \n\nYou can also watch a flash video of this episode through your web-browser here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-between-two-worlds-life-on-the-border/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-between-two-worlds-life-on-the-border/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef78c90f11504f0fe16b133c10298f1b578f730a","amp;dn":"Moyers+%26amp%3B+Company%2C+May+4+2012%3A+Between+Two+Worlds+-+Life+on+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef78c90f11504f0fe16b133c10298f1b578f730a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,120,201,15,17,80,79,15,225,107,19,60,16,41,143,27,87,143,115,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
