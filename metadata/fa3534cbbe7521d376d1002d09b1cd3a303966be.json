Supernatural beings are real. And from the dawn of time they've lived amongst humanity: Vampires, Werewolves, Angels, Demons, Wicans, Trolls, Gorgons and Banshees. Each different from the other, but connected by one commonality - all are genetically superior to man.\n\nEPOCH is the dark and gritty tale of our reluctant hero, Jonah Bishop, an NYPD detective assigned to a mysterious murder case that swipes him from his modern day reality and plunges him into the shadow world of his heritage Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Supernatural. Jonah's quest unveils a deep-rooted family secret, dropping him deep in the middle of a conspiracy that threatens to tear the very fabric of our society. To expose the killer of his partner, Michael, the investigation will force him to compete in EPOCH, an ancient fighting tournament where the outcome holds the key to the future of humanity.
