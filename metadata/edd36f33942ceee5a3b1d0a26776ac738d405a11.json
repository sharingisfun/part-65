Not long after Angela's arrival, things start to go horribly wrong for anyone with sinister or less than honorable intentions. \n\nStoryline\n\nAfter a horrible boating accident kills her family, Angela, a shy and sullen young girl, moves in with her eccentric aunt Martha, alongside her protective cousin Ricky. One summer, Martha sends the kids to Camp Arawak. Soon after their arrival, a series of bizarre and increasingly violent accidents begins to claim the lives of various campers. Who is the twisted individual behind these murders? The disclosure of the murderer's identity is the most shocking climax in the history of American cinema. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086320/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086320/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edd36f33942ceee5a3b1d0a26776ac738d405a11","amp;dn":"SleepAway+Camp+%281983%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edd36f33942ceee5a3b1d0a26776ac738d405a11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,211,111,51,148,44,238,229,163,177,208,162,103,118,172,115,141,64,90,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
