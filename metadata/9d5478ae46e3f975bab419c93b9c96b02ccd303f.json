(John Grant cover) The lyrics to &quot;The Queen Of Denamark&quot; faithfully depicts not only the type of personality that SinÃƒÂ©ad has as well as mirrors many of his positions regarding, in particular, of the excess of public trial, which she always was target. In several passages of the interpretation, it is clear to her identification with the lycris, even boot the smiles on her part. A great singer, magnificent performer and a woman of attitudes much ahead of his time.\n\nRecorded at Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, UK, 10 March 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5478ae46e3f975bab419c93b9c96b02ccd303f","amp;dn":"Sin%26eacute%3Bad+O%27Connor+-+Queen+Of+Dennmark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5478ae46e3f975bab419c93b9c96b02ccd303f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,84,120,174,70,227,249,117,186,180,25,201,59,156,150,176,44,205,48,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
