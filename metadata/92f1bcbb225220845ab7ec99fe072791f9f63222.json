Their sound was passionate and compelling with a sound that was cutting edge at the time; heavily influenced by the late '80s Dischord hardcore sound. At the time emotive hardcore was something new and exciting. It was all about passion, anger, and was really just another aspect of hardcore... long before emo was turned into frivolous pop punk. This double CD anthology captures all of their studio material (17 tracks) as well as 6 live tracks recorded in Germany in 1995 (a couple of which have never been heard before). Policy of 3 helped to define this sound/genera and this release is an amazing testament to one of the great hardcore bands from that time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f1bcbb225220845ab7ec99fe072791f9f63222","amp;dn":"Policy+Of+3+-+Anthology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f1bcbb225220845ab7ec99fe072791f9f63222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,241,188,187,34,82,32,132,90,183,236,153,254,7,39,145,249,246,50,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
