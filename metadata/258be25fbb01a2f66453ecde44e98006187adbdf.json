There's still plenty of firepower, but you'll get an inside look at many of the breakthrough technologies designed to take on the challenges of terrorism, bomb threats, and close combat urban battlefields.\n\n\n\n5)  Guns \nFuture Weapons goes big on guns starting with the rapid-fire cannon that are fast becoming a huge hit with the U.S. armed forces. Next up, Mack takes a helicopter ride where he unleashes a firestorm with the lightweight Dillon Aero Gatling gun. On an Arizona firing range, he tests a new multi-calibre combat weapon that's lighter and tougher than any other weapon in its class. In the finale, Mack checks out a new breed of personal defence weapons that have the stopping power -- and amazingly, the accuracy -- of much bigger weapons.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img252.imageshack.us/img252/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img252.imageshack.us/img252/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/1954/futureweaponsseason3scro.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/1954/futureweaponsseason3scro.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img821.imageshack.us/img821/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img821.imageshack.us/img821/208/futureweaponsseason3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2112 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.8000 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 44.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Weapons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Weapons&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:258be25fbb01a2f66453ecde44e98006187adbdf","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Future+Weapons+Season+3+05of10+Guns+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"258be25fbb01a2f66453ecde44e98006187adbdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,139,226,95,187,1,162,246,100,83,236,222,68,233,128,6,24,122,219,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
