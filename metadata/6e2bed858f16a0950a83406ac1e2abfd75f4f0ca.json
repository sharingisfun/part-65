Re-Volt lets gamers race cars in places they're always wanted to, but couldn't, until now. Racers dodge full-sized cars in city streets, slalomaround enormous dinosaur skeletons in museums, and jump over gigantic building blocks in toy stores.\nEverything in the world is built to scale, so even normal-sized objects like baseballs and pencils are formidable roadblocks. Power-ups give cars offensive and defensive weaponry, like bottle rockets and oil slicks. Gamers can join others and race or play tag over the Internet on tracks designed specifically for multiplayer action.\n\nPentium-200, Windows 95/98, 32MB RAM, 3D card\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e2bed858f16a0950a83406ac1e2abfd75f4f0ca","amp;dn":"Re-Volt+1.10%5BRIP%5D+%2B+rv+house%28for+online+play%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e2bed858f16a0950a83406ac1e2abfd75f4f0ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,43,237,133,143,22,160,149,10,131,64,106,193,226,171,253,117,244,240,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
