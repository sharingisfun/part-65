Everyone's favorite teacher, Mr. Simon (Ed Harris), pairs Andy with the school's biggest outcast and social pariah, Stanley, aka &quot;Big G&quot; (Alexander Walters) on a critical term project. Sporting thick orange hair, a head too big for his body and ears too big for his head, &quot;Big G&quot; has been the object of ridicule since grade school.
