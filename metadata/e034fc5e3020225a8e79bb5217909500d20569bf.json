There may have been more songs made available that way, but these are all I managed to get.  Some of the songs are similar to tracks on his final two albums, but others have never appeared on CD. \n\nTrack listing:  \n1.  Adeste Fideles\n2.  She moved through the fair\n3.  Silent night\n4.  The Magic garden\n5.  Your heart's desire\n6.  Fever\n7.  Imagination\n8.  Kyrie Eleison\n\nIf you're as big a fan of Gerry as I am, you'll want to have these in your collection if only to compare and contrast what was done to the songs before they went out on CD.  But my favourite among these is the traditional Irish song &quot;She moved through the fair&quot; - sung beautifully and with wonderful minimal rhythm and instrumentation (at least, that's my opinion).  \n\nEnjoy these works from a late, great artist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e034fc5e3020225a8e79bb5217909500d20569bf","amp;dn":"Gerry+Rafferty+tracks+from+GerryRafferty.com+-+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e034fc5e3020225a8e79bb5217909500d20569bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,52,252,94,48,32,34,90,142,121,187,82,23,144,149,0,210,5,105,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
