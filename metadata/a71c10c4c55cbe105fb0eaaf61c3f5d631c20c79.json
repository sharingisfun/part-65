Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?\n \nBoth the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.\n \nCraft unique weapons, obtain randomized loot and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!\n\nMy eigth upload. Hope you guys enjoy!\n\n-AppRipper \nHappy Hacking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71c10c4c55cbe105fb0eaaf61c3f5d631c20c79","amp;dn":"Towns+0.47a+MAC+COMPILED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71c10c4c55cbe105fb0eaaf61c3f5d631c20c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,28,16,196,197,92,190,16,95,176,234,175,97,195,245,214,49,194,12,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
