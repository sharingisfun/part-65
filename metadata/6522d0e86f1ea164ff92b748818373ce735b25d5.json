Suddenly popping up everywhere on wooden \ncrates in which the victims were brutally murdered in the same. It is Martin Beck and his team \nto deal with the sadistic serial killer responsible for these atrocities. But the culprit seems \nto them always a step ahead\n\nBeck: Buried Alive is the last movie in the Beck series was made. Fans need not worry that the \nfilm is unintelligible without the four seasons of Beck first post. Previous experience is not \nnecessary in this story, based on the crime novels of the Swedish couple SjÃƒÂ¶wall WahlÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ¶ and \nwrote in the seventies. Distributor LumiÃƒÂ¨re also gives a box with the book under the title \nscreen adaptations: Beck: The Book adaptations. Can not miss. Buried Alive is based on the \ncharacters from the books, but is at least as good as the original.\n\nBeck: Buried Alive, is another Scandinavian thriller in the now long tradition of including \nWallander and Van Veeteren. Inspector Martin Beck, played by Peter Haber, a sadistic serial \nkiller who try to stop burying people alive everywhere in Stockholm. He is assisted by his \nfaithful colleague Gunvald Larsson, played by Mikael Brandt Press. The Dutch public knows Peter \nHaber of its more sinister role as Martin Fowler in Millennium I (Men Who Hate Women), a role \nthat stands in stark contrast with the winning Beck. The role of the Swedish police inspector \nHaber sits like a glove, not surprising after less than 26 episodes of 90 minutes. Beck is not \nonly strongly influenced by the Superintendent, the series should also have his sense of humor. \nThe short fuse and sarcasm Larsson provides the necessary relaxation during the investigations. \nAlso funny is the crazy neighbor Beck, who with a band around his neck seems to have \npermanently sick and always in for a drink.\n\nThe plot is similar to most Scandinavian thrillers. It is very well organized, with emphasis on \nhuman psyche and enough twists. The subject of the film is somewhat less socially oriented than \nis visible in the original work of SjÃƒÂ¶wall and WahlÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ¶, but this is more a plus than a minus \nmissing. An exciting film, and a nice opportunity to get acquainted with Beck.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.crimezone.nl/web/Home/At-the-Movies/Film/BECK-BURIED-ALIVE-.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.crimezone.nl/web/Home/At-the-Movies/Film/BECK-BURIED-ALIVE-.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInfo :\nBron           : Retail\nFormaat        : DVD5\nAudio          : DD51\nGesproken taal : Zweeds\nOndertiteling  : Nederlands\nBeeldverhouding: 16:9\nFramerate      : 25,000 fps\nStandaard      : PAL \nMenu           : Ja\nExtra's        : Ja\nCover          : Ja\n\n\n\n[img]http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/589/blacksam3.jpg[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6522d0e86f1ea164ff92b748818373ce735b25d5","amp;dn":"Beck+Buried+Alive+2011+Retail+NL+Subs--TBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6522d0e86f1ea164ff92b748818373ce735b25d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,34,208,232,111,30,161,100,255,146,183,72,129,131,115,206,115,91,37,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
