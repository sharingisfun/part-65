I wish to apologize. This is NOT a film-noir. Sure enough, the hero is doomed. A poor ill-fated guy helplessly in love with Linda Darnell (who wouldn't ?). Sure enough there are gangsters, shootings, cops, action, suspense. Yet again, this is not a film-noir. But it's such fun that I could not resist including it in that list. The first absolutely phony film-noir in this list. There should not be many others so, make sure to enjoy that one (for those who have not already seen it). You should not regret it.\n\nNO SUBS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6559d1b6837d694f3a66cfd03de07fa4cd85078f","amp;dn":"It+Happened+Tomorrow+%281944%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6559d1b6837d694f3a66cfd03de07fa4cd85078f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,89,209,182,131,125,105,79,58,102,207,208,61,224,127,164,205,133,7,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
