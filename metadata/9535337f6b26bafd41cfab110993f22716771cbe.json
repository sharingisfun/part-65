Within it's short (18 months or so) career the band successfully tried to become the loudest and the hardest acid rock band - but without acid. Today they would've been called Christian rock. Back then, it was an act of short-lived Jesus Rock Movement - the musicians tried to preach (&quot;Let Jesus bring you back&quot;, &quot;Life everlasting&quot;...) through acid-rock sound. Even the name of the band had Biblical reference. However, fronted by vocalists Sharon Keel and Ken Fitch, and supported by drummer Eddie Johnson (with Juliard background) the group achieved impressive results. In 1971 Monument Studios in Nashville (not the best place to play acid-rock) recorder this classic album.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Life Everlasting\n2. You Can\n3. Let Jesus Bring You Back\n4.
