Climbing into an old lighthouse on the beach to swill a six-pack of beer, Rose stumbles upon a sleeping British teenager (Olly Alexander) whom she wakes and insists on taking somewhere. Stranded by some unknown party, the chatty, ludicrously attired youth accompanies Rose to a brewery where Ã¢â‚¬Å“the other womanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was recently employed and then to her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ summer getaway house, slowly attuning to her anguish. As the grey winter days roll by, the mismatched pair embark on a series of frolicsome adventures-English dance lessons, role-playing in public-that bring them into closer quarters, igniting a bittersweet, perhaps imaginary romance. \n\nGenre: Comedy | Drama | Romance \nIMDB Rating: 6.7/10 \nDirected by: Alison Bagnall \nStarring: Greta Gerwig, Olly Alexander and Eleonore Hendricks \n\nRelease Name: The.Dish.And.The.Spoon.2011.DVDRip.XviD-AEN \nSize: 700 MiB \nVideo: XVID, 624Ãƒâ€”352, 932 kbps, 23.976 fps \nAudio: English, MP3, 128 Kbps \nRuntime: 90 mins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a74ab470876765d9acb30f1beee74e1aae1e9de","amp;dn":"The+Dish+And+The+Spoon+2011+DVDRip+XviD-AEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a74ab470876765d9acb30f1beee74e1aae1e9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,116,171,71,8,118,118,93,154,203,48,241,190,238,116,225,170,225,233,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
