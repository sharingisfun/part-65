That maybe a fair comment, but I always give the name the name of the program and the channel that it was broadcast on. If you Ã¢â‚¬Å“googleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that, you will usually find all the information that you need.\n\n  \n\nI wanted to give something back for all the downloads that I took over the last few years, so I started to upload interesting programs, mostly from BBC2 and BBC4, that nobody else uploads. I have time to do that because I am quite badly disabled, and can seldom leave the house. \n\n \n\nI am almost blind, and I have many physical problems that make it difficult for me to use a keyboard, so I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t  give information that able bodied pirates can easily find out for themselves !!\n\n \n\nBut your comments are appreciated, so please leave them, good or bad  !!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9891d18ce78805da40a1865a7777c51a4de51c2","amp;dn":"BBC4+Man+Of+The+World.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9891d18ce78805da40a1865a7777c51a4de51c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,137,29,24,206,120,128,93,164,10,24,101,167,119,124,81,164,222,81,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
