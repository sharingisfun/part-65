People of many races and nationalities are represented. Careful wording bridges one chronologically arranged article to the next, enhancing the idea that one person's work builds on an earlier individual's accomplishments. The style of writing varies some from article to article. Some pieces are written in an accessible, straightforward style, while others are convoluted. Painters and Sculptors states, for example, that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the complex culture of late Medicean Florence, which was simultaneously infused with the romantic sentiment of courtly love and with the humanist interest for Classical antiquity and its vanished artistic traditions, employed these mythological figures more fully and in more correctly antiquarian fashion. That aside, this series is a goldmine. A few black-and-white illustrations appear throughout.\n(c) Copyright 2010. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.
