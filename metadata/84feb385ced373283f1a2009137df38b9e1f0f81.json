For the first time since the late 1960s, Manchester emerged as the capital of English football in 2011/12, as 19-times champions United were confronted by local rivals City in a local skirmish which spilled over into a battle for the Barclays Premier League title. Sir Alex Ferguson had seen off all challengers in the Premier League era, but he celebrated his 25th year at the Old Trafford helm with one of his sternest challenges yet: battling not only the inflated riches and ambition of City, but also overhauling his own squad and blooding a new generation of youngsters. United's twinkling talents dazzled in the early months of the campaign, but were slowed by a damaging home defeat to City and a crippling run of injuries. There were also harsh lessons in European and domestic cup competitions, but the Reds roared back in time-honoured fashion to sprint for the line in an absorbing race for the league title. With highlights, exclusive interviews and analysis, the Manchester United 2011/12 Season Review will take you through every twist and turn of a typically undulating season following the Reds. From the early-season swagger to the breathless late charge for glory, via every peak and trough in between, there is no better way to relive another thrilling campaign. \n\n\nLanguage: English\nFormat : MKV\nVideo : AVC, Bit rate: 1500 Kbps\nWidth: 714 pixels, Height: 576 pixels\nFrame rate: 25 fps\n\nAudio : AAC, Bit rate: 128 Kbps\nChannel (s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nDuration: 2 Hours 5 Minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84feb385ced373283f1a2009137df38b9e1f0f81","amp;dn":"Manchester+United+Season+Review+2011%2F12++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84feb385ced373283f1a2009137df38b9e1f0f81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,254,179,133,206,211,115,40,63,26,32,9,19,125,243,139,158,31,15,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
