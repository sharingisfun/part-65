Everyone wants to try this &quot;orgasm&quot; drug but no one considers the side effects. This drug took its first victims in 1646. The church soon discovered that the blood-drained corpses found around the countryside were due to strigol, an elixir that made select victims thirst for blood. The drug wears off in hours, but while under its influence average men turn into animals. The church destroyed much of the strigol, or the vampire, but not all. And now it's back. It's October 2004, and some college students are throwing a party at an abandoned farm to introduce their latest discovery, AYCE, a drug they promise is like nothing else. The one person who knows the side effects arrives too late. The bash becomes a bloodbath, and for the next few hours no one knows who will become the next victim or the next vampire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a745c6d8fd9ed4f894ae3e3380e56b5d2e92c10","amp;dn":"sideFX+%282005%29+DVDRip+Amber+Heard%2C+Side+FX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a745c6d8fd9ed4f894ae3e3380e56b5d2e92c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,116,92,109,143,217,237,79,137,74,227,227,56,14,86,181,210,233,44,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
