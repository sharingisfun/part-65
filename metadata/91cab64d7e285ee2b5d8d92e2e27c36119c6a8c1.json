For example, today's \n                   Nigerian email scam is nothing more than a derivation of a Spanish Conquistador's bait and switch con that started \n                   around the year 1400. Paul Wilson, dubbed the &quot;World's Greatest Con Man,&quot; and his team take viewers inside long and \n                   complicated schemes and even the micro-cons that have plagued unsuspecting people for hundreds, even thousands of \n                   years. Paul has successfully pulled more scams on real people than anyone in history, but he doesn't take their \n                   money. His goal is to expose these cons, hustles and schemes so that he can teach others how to avoid them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cab64d7e285ee2b5d8d92e2e27c36119c6a8c1","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Scammed.HDTV.XviD-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cab64d7e285ee2b5d8d92e2e27c36119c6a8c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,202,182,77,126,40,94,226,181,216,217,46,46,39,195,97,25,198,168,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
