But stability came at a price: for nearly 250 years, Japan was a land closed to the Western world, ruled by the shogun under his absolute power and control. Japan: Memoirs of a Secret Empire brings to life the unknown story of a mysterious empire, its relationship with the West, and the forging of a nation that would emerge as one of the most important countries in the world. \n\n\nEPISODE ONE: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI\nTokugawa Ieyasu unifies Japan and establishes a dynasty that will rule Japan for over 250 years. \n\n\nEPISODE TWO: THE WILL OF THE SHOGUN\nThe grandson of Ieyasu, Tokugawa Iemitsu, tightens control over Japan's warlords and expels all foreigners. \n\n\nEPISODE THREE: THE RETURN OF THE BARBARIANS\nIsolated from the West, 18th century Edo flourishes culturally and economically, becoming one of the liveliest cities in the world. But foreign forces are coming.
