Over time the two races entered into treaties with the Herald Accord, a union between different cultures in the galaxy. Even though peace settled across their planets, the seething hatred between the races kept the fire of war simmering under the fragile truce. Sensing their newest members could spread war throughout the galaxy; the Herald Accord gave the Kavussari and Forsellians a choice. Pit their warriors against each other in the arena rather than on the fields of war, or face total annihilation. The Nexuiz was formed, a series of battle arenas on the home planets of the Kavussari, Forsellian and the ruined planet of Atavirta. A full reimagining of Alien Trap SoftwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cult-classic shooter, Nexuiz is a fast-paced, arena-based FPS based on the CryEngine 3. The game features a mutator system that allows players to change the rules of the match; as players rank, new mutators become available for them to use. Leader boards are designed for social networking, letting players feel more engaged with the community.\n\n[b]Features:[/b]\n\n-  Arena FPS is back Ã¢â‚¬â€œ inspired by the giants of the Arena FPS genre, Nexuiz reinvents twitch gaming for next generation consoles and PC\n    \n- Over 100 Ã¢â‚¬ËœDynamic MutatorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ serve as game-changing power-ups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jetpacks, Uber-Nuke, Low Gravity, Big Head Mode and many moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n    \n- 9 deadly arenas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ powered by CryENGINE 3, Nexuiz sets a new graphical benchmark for a digital-only release\n    \n- Designed for competitive play Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a superbly balanced weapon set, classic game modes, and extensive stat tracking, Medals and Leaderboard support\n    \n- Play solo or online Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hone your skills against bots, then wage war online against the best in 4v4 multiplayer matches\n\n[img]http://rapidimg.org/images/tTIuA.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://rapidimg.org/images/u9M3l.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Install notes:[/b]\n\n-  Burn or mount\n-  Install the game \n- Play the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96421b6d4ed2544ad05b41e81a0bcf49d6e33536","amp;dn":"Nexuiz-FLT%5BEtGamez%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96421b6d4ed2544ad05b41e81a0bcf49d6e33536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,66,27,109,78,210,84,74,208,91,65,232,26,11,207,73,214,227,53,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
