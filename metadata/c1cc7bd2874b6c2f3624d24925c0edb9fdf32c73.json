This losing streak even extends to a failed lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully browbeats her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one takes her seriously, with her trashy clothes and earthy manners, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company. What she discovers is that the company is trying quietly to buy land that was contaminated by hexavalent chromium, a deadly toxic waste that the company is improperly and illegally dumping and, in turn, poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her lawfirm in one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-billion dollar corporation. \n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mapmnaadd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mapmnaadd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mapmoaadd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mapmoaadd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mapmpaadd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/mapmpaadd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/napmaaadd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/napmaaadd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1cc7bd2874b6c2f3624d24925c0edb9fdf32c73","amp;dn":"Erin.Brockovich.2000.x264.aac.Audios.Eng.Ger.17.Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1cc7bd2874b6c2f3624d24925c0edb9fdf32c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,204,123,210,135,75,108,47,54,36,210,73,37,192,237,185,253,243,44,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
