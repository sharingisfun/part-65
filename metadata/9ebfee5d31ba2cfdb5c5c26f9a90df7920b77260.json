Luke is the kind of reporter who meticulously fact checks his work before submitting it for print, so when his editors reject an article detailing atrocities committed by Canadian soldiers against Afghani civilians, he indignantly quits. Subsequently offered a job writing about Afghani hashish for a high profile marijuana advocacy magazine, Luke returns to the war-torn country to conduct further research, but discovers that the situation has greatly deteriorated since his last visit.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 3.9/10 from 101 users\nDirected by: Mike Clattenburg\nStarring: Nick Stahl, Nicolas Wright and Stephen Lobo\n\nRelease Name: Afghan.Luke.2011.FESTiVAL.DVDRip.XviD-EXViD\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: XviD | 640Ãƒâ€”272 | 940 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 139 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 29min\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ebfee5d31ba2cfdb5c5c26f9a90df7920b77260","amp;dn":"Afghan+Luke+2011+FESTiVAL+DVDRip+XviD-EXViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ebfee5d31ba2cfdb5c5c26f9a90df7920b77260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,191,238,93,49,186,44,253,181,197,194,111,154,144,223,121,32,183,114,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
