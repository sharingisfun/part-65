He travels alone, but a ragtag group of outcasts is drawn to him-- and Wales can't leave his motley surrogate family unprotected. Eastwood's skill before and behind the camera remains unparalleled in Hollywood history. \n\nEven Orson Welles? &quot;I reckon so.&quot;\n\nI have limited bandwidth. So please be patient.\n\nAnd seed as much as you can.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13d55845873f7a71b106853b404bd90752f9abd","amp;dn":"The+Outlaw+Josey+Wales+1976+Clint+Eastwood+HDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13d55845873f7a71b106853b404bd90752f9abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,61,85,132,88,115,247,167,27,16,104,83,180,4,189,144,117,47,154,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
