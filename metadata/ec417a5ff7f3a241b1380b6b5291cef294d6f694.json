Another secondary use is for operating systems and/or computer security courses, which benefit from the simple structure of Owl and from our inclusion of the complete build environment.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHi,\n\nOpenwall GNU/*/Linux 3.0-stable has been updated to include almost all\nchanges made and tested in Owl-current in recent months, including new\npackage additions, and excluding only changes that would break binary\ncompatibility with the 3.0 release (specifically, Owl-current's OpenSSL\nupdate and related changes are excluded from 3.0-stable):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES-3.0-stable.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES-3.0-stable.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou may download new ISOs for i686 and x86_64 via direct links from the\nOwl homepage:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor you may download them from many of the mirrors:\n\n\n(well, except for kernel.org at this time, for well-known reasons).\n\nNew OpenVZ container templates, binary RPMs, and indeed sources are also\navailable from the mirrors.  Not all mirrors have picked those up yet,\nbut at least the Russian, French, Czech, and German mirrors did.  Things\nshould propagate to all mirrors (except for kernel.org if it stays down)\nwithin one day.\n\nLet me use this opportunity to remind you that it's a good idea to check\nsignatures on software you download, including from our mirrors.  For\nOwl, we generate *.mtree files with the mtree(8) program (which is part\nof Owl and *BSD), and we sign those files with GnuPG.  Our PGP keys used\nfor signing may be downloaded from:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/signatures/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/signatures/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(as well as from keyservers), and they're part of the PGP web of trust.\n\nSample shell commands to verify downloads of Owl RPMs and sources may be\nfound at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://openwall.info/wiki/Owl/upgrade#Download-the-new-stuff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://openwall.info/wiki/Owl/upgrade#Download-the-new-stuff&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor ISOs, you need to download iso.mtree and iso.mtree.sign (from the\nsame directory with the ISOs themselves), then run commands like:\n\ngpg iso.mtree.sign\nmtree -f iso.mtree\n\nand pay attention to their output as the wiki page above says.\n\nIf you do not have mtree installed, verify the signature on iso.mtree\nwith 'gpg iso.mtree.sign' as suggested above, but then compute the SHA-1\ndigest for the downloaded ISO with sha1sum or with 'openssl dgst -sha1'\nand compare it against one found inside the iso.mtree file.\n\nFor OpenVZ container templates, everything is similar except that the\ntwo files are vztemplate.mtree and vztemplate.mtree.sign, respectively.\n\nAs usual, any feedback is welcome on owl-users.\n\nAlexander &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2011/09/09/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2011/09/09/1&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES-3.0-stable.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES-3.0-stable.shtml&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/signatures/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/signatures/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/donations/paypal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.openwall.com/donations/paypal&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec417a5ff7f3a241b1380b6b5291cef294d6f694","amp;dn":"Owl-3_0-stable-20110909-i686.iso.gz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec417a5ff7f3a241b1380b6b5291cef294d6f694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,65,122,95,247,243,162,65,177,56,11,107,82,145,206,242,148,214,246,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
