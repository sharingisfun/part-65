It has gorgeous soundtrack by Nitin Sawhney which complements the visuals perfectly. \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the third film from the collaboration between Himansu Rai and German director Franz Osten, which had already produced Light of Asia and Shiraz. Osten was working with his brother Peter OstermayrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production company Emelka in Germany when he met Himansu and Devika Rani, and came to India to work with them on these joint efforts. This partnership also gave us 1936 Achhut Kanya starring Ashok Kumar and Devika Rani; but when World War II broke out Osten and the other German technicians were arrested by the British and then deported, and Himansu Rai died in 1940.\n\nA Throw of Dice features 10,000 extras, a thousand horses and fifty elephants (loaned by a local maharajah), and is gorgeously filmed  on lush sets and beautiful outdoor locations in Rajasthan. Himansu himself plays the villain in this, with Seeta Devi and Charu Roy in the other two lead roles. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an entertaining and fast-paced story of intrigue, treachery and romance against a Mughal court backdrop penned by Niranjan Pal (based on a story from the Mahabharata).\n\nThe film has been in the British Film Institute (BFI)Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s archives since 1945, though rarely seen. In 2006, the film was digitally restored, in honour of the 60th anniversary of Indian independence, and re-released at the Luminato Festival, Toronto, Canada, on 13 June 2008, with a new orchestral score by British Indian composer, Nitin Sawhney.\n\nPlot :-\nThe movie is about two kings vying for the love of a hermit's daughter, the beautiful Sunita. The two kings, Ranjit and Sohat share a passion for gambling and decide to play a game of craps to determine who will marry Sunita. Sunita wishes to marry Ranjit. Ranjit loses the game to the nefarious Sohat and as a forfeit becomes his slave. Sunita soon uncovers the truth about Sohat's evil deeds and to escape punishment he hurls himself off a cliff into the rapids below. Ranjit and Sunita are reunited and married.\n\nCast:\nSeeta Devi...Sunita\nHimansu Rai...King Sohat\nCharu Roy...King Ranjit\nModhu Bose...Kirkbar, King Sohat's Henchman\nSarada Gupta...Kanwa, Sunita's Father, the Hermit\nTincory Chakrabarty...Kanzler Raghunath\nLala Bijoykishen...Raghunath's Son Birbal \n\nMedia Info\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 1.02 GB\nVideo Codec - H264/AVC\nVideo Res - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps \nVideo Bitrate - 956 Kbps\nSAudio Codec - MP3\nChannels - Stereo\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 2 Hours 32 mins\n\nPoster: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/oIrmK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/oIrmK&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/rYJhV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/rYJhV&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/i1ZO5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/i1ZO5&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/X3v4G&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/X3v4G&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/rIIYq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/rIIYq&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/TbsUL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/TbsUL&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/YyrmP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/YyrmP&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f80939220bb31e4c451bb0ec00011e81356750","amp;dn":"A+Throw+Of+Dice%7E1929%7EVintage+Silent+Classic%7EDVDRip%7E1.02+GB%7EPhant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f80939220bb31e4c451bb0ec00011e81356750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,248,9,57,34,11,179,30,76,69,27,176,236,0,1,30,129,53,103,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
