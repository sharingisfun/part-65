It was released on November 4, 2000 through Bigwig Enterprises. Although it is commonly referred to as a full-length album, Amy Lee explicitly refers to it as a &quot;dressed up&quot; demo CD. Only 2,500 copies were pressed and sold at the band's live concerts in Little Rock, Arkansas and on the Bigwig Enterprises website. However, pirated versions of the album later began selling for over $300 on eBay, making it nearly impossible to receive an original copy.\nOrigin contains the earlier versions of &quot;My Immortal,&quot; &quot;Imaginary&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot;, which were later re-recorded for the band's debut album Fallen. Origin is also considerably different from the band's later releases, containing more industrial pieces of music whilst the tracks are more linked to others.\n\nBitrate:   192kb/s\nTracks:    11\nFormat:    MP3\nAlbun art: Yes, embedded\n\nTrack list:\n\n01 Origin.mp3\n02 Whisper.mp3\n03 Imaginary.mp3\n04 My Immortal.mp3\n05 Where Will You Go.mp3\n06 Field Of Innocence.mp3\n07 Even In Death.mp3\n08 Anywhere.mp3\n09 Lies.mp3\n10 Away From Me.mp3\n11 Eternal.mp3\n\nHappy listening ;)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b2a84f63d72e63a2fdd2a55bc87bcff0f42756","amp;dn":"Evanescence+-+Origin+%28Original+11-track%2C+2000+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b2a84f63d72e63a2fdd2a55bc87bcff0f42756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,178,168,79,99,215,46,99,162,253,210,165,91,200,123,207,240,244,39,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
