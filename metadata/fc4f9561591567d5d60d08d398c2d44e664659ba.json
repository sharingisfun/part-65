This is Part one, with the other 9 parts to follow. I believe the last part is a special behind the scense thing that only came with the box set, so be sure to get that if you like this movie, the best WWII movie of all time. Enjoy! PS- if i got any parts in the wrong order, or anythings wrong, please let me know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc4f9561591567d5d60d08d398c2d44e664659ba","amp;dn":"Band+of+Brothers+Part+1++%28H264%29+Ipod.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc4f9561591567d5d60d08d398c2d44e664659ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,79,149,97,89,21,103,213,214,13,8,211,152,194,212,78,102,70,89,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
