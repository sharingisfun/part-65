While, in retrospect, fellow graduates of the class of 1987 are about as cool as poodle perms and spandex, the L.A. bad boys still rock like gods. Listening to the sun-drenched chords of &quot;Paradise City&quot; and the ensuing stadium-sized swagger is enough to make wearing leather trousers and bandanas seem like a good idea. Of course, it helped that for them sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll was a way of life,\nnot a fashion statement. As Axl Rose wails &quot;I wanna watch you bleed&quot; on &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; like a chain-smoking lunatic possessed, it's hard not to believe he meant it. Yet equally, it was his surprisingly poetic nature that made genuinely touching love songs of &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child of Mine.&quot;\n\nThough none of their subsequent albums matched the drug-crazed genius of Appetite for Destruction, they did, as the Greatest Hits reminds, have their moments. From the bloated Use Your Illusion I &amp; II came ultimate rock ballads &quot;Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;November Rain,&quot; along with the primal rage that was &quot;You Could Be Mine.&quot; And while the covers of the The Spaghetti Incident? were largely forgettable, the fact that their final single was a seedy sneer through the Rolling Stones' &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; seems spectacularly fitting. --Dan Gennoes\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Welcome to the jungle                                [04:32]\n02.Sweet child O' mine                                  [05:55]\n03.Patience                                             [05:56]\n04.Paradise city                                        [06:48]\n05.Knockin' on heaven's door                            [05:36]\n06.Civil war                                            [07:42]\n07.You could be mine                                    [05:44]\n08.Don't cry (original)                                 [04:46]\n09.November rain                                        [08:57]\n10.Live and let die                                     [03:02]\n11.Yesterdays                                           [03:16]\n12.Ain't it fun                                         [05:08]\n13.Since I don't have you                               [04:19]\n14.Sympathy for the devil                               [07:36]\n____\n\n79:17 min\n122,8 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
