In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as:\n\nBenchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting in a corner of your screen.  Perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame rate between any two points.  Save the statistics out to disk and use them for your own reviews and applications.\n\nScreen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key!  There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot.  Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped.\n\nRealtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video while playing your favourite game?  Come join the Machinima revolution!  Throw away the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never been this easy!  Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560x1600 with custom frame rates from 1 to 120 frames per second!\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!\n\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n\nChangelog\n\nFraps 3.5.3 - 27th May, 2012\n\n- Fixed micro-stutter in recorded video after temporary framerate drop \n- Fixed missing video frames in some games after rendering paused\n- Fixed bug causing error message on startup for some users\n\n\nFraps 3.5.2 - 20th May 2012\n\n- Fixed missing audio at end of long recordings\n- Fixed error preventing movie playback in Windows Media Player\n- Fixed screen freezing when starting video capture in Minecraft &amp; other OpenGL games\n- Fixed crash during video mode switch in DosBox\n\nFraps 3.5.1 - 18th May 2012\n\n- Added support for exFAT drives writing larger than 4 Gigabytes\n- Fixed crash when large custom resolutions used in game\n\nFraps 3.5.0 - 26th April 2012\n\n- Support for large AVI movie files (above 4 Gigabytes) on NTFS drives\n- Added option to split AVIs at 4 Gigabytes for legacy AVI 1.0 support\n- Fixed loop recording using large amounts of disk space for short clips\n- Fixed benchmark logs not being saved if game was quit before benchmark ended\n- Fixed View folder not opening window on some machines\n\n- NEW MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: CPU with SSE2 required (Pentium 4 &amp; above)\n- Windows 2000 is no longer supported (Windows XP &amp; above)\n\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d703bedd6deb209bbabce5f6bebfe725409a6a5","amp;dn":"Beepa+Fraps+v3.5.3+build+15007+Retail+-+100%25+Clean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d703bedd6deb209bbabce5f6bebfe725409a6a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,112,59,237,214,222,178,9,187,171,206,95,107,235,254,114,84,9,166,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
