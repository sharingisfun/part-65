He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1130903494c63bbdcdc0bf22814f8b541772ca8","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Prophetic+Times+-+57+-+Mystery+Babylon+Vol+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1130903494c63bbdcdc0bf22814f8b541772ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,19,9,3,73,76,99,187,220,220,11,242,40,20,248,181,65,119,44,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
