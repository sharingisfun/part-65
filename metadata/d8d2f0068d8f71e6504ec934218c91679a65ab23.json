The story takes place in southern Poland during the Soviet Offensive in the summer of 1944. The player takes on the role of a Russian or German infantryman, using teamwork, tactical skill and authentic war machines to battle for victory. The German campaign focuses on slowing the advance of the Soviet troops, while the Soviet campaign is all about breaking through the enemy's resistance. However, the player does not have to do all this on foot: using their computers, tacticians control tanks, including the famous German battle tank Panzerkampfwagen VI or &quot;KÃƒÂ¶nigstiger&quot; and the Russian Stalin tank JS2, or fighter planes such as the Focke Wulf 190 and dive bombers like the Stuka or the Petlyakov PE-2.\n\nOnline is where the battle really heats up in Iron Front: Liberation 1944 -- players can complete missions either cooperatively or compete with each other in special multiplayer modes such as &quot;Capture the Flag&quot; or &quot;Attack and Defense&quot;.
