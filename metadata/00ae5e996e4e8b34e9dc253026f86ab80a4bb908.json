In its wake a pathogen emerges that threatens the entire world. Jake Miller is a former combat pilot and soldier of fortune haunted by his past. He is the only survivor to an outbreak years earlier while working in the jungles of Panama with parallels to ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s epidemic. His blood runs cold when CNN confirms itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmouse poxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spreading fast. How could this be? Jake enlists the help of a friend and private investigator and start to dig but someone wants to bury him and the events of Panama. Jake and his family flee across America amidst the breakdown of society, the fall of man and the rise of a new dominant species while being hunted by those who want him silenced. Jake may be the last man on earth who can piece together the truth and save his family if he lives long enough.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00ae5e996e4e8b34e9dc253026f86ab80a4bb908","amp;dn":"Playing+God+-+Douglas+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00ae5e996e4e8b34e9dc253026f86ab80a4bb908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,174,94,153,110,78,139,52,233,220,37,48,38,248,106,184,10,75,185,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
