It's a kickback against nonsense genre terminologies and a fight-back against the self-appointed style councils that try to tell us what music's cool and what the latest must-like is. Against tracks that have such a mish-mash of sound styles that even their producers don't know what they are making. This album is both a purification and celebration of the term TRANCE. I'm reclaiming it, for all those who just want to dance to music that takes them to another place, for whom this music is a feeling, a passion, a way of life. So I say: VIVE LA TRANCE! You need to be proud of what makes you feel goodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ To all of you who know your own minds, this album contains PURE trance - embrace it!&quot; - Richard Mowatt, Solarstone.\n\nRelease Date: 21st May 2012.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1)  Solarstone - Pure (6:56)\n2)  Solarstone &amp; Clare Stagg - Jewel (7:14)\n3)  Solarstone &amp; Bill McGruddy - Shake The Demons (7:07)\n4)  Solarstone - Voyager (7:52)\n5)  Solarstone &amp; Betsie Larkin - Where Do We Go From Here (4:55)\n6)  Solarstone &amp; Aly &amp; Fila - Fireisland (6:26)\n7)  Solarstone &amp; Clare Stagg - Requiem (6:46)\n8)  Solarstone &amp; Giuseppe Ottaviani - Falcons (6:12)\n9)  Solarstone - Please (5:32)\n10) Solarstone &amp; Clare Stagg - The Spell (5:14)\n11) Solarstone - Lovers (4:58)\n12) Solarstone - Presence Of The Past (7:18)\n13) Solarstone &amp; Hannah Magenta - Swansong (5:51) \n\n\n\n100% virus free.\n\n\n\nThese are only 128kbps as I reduce all my albums to this bit rate so that I fit more music onto my iPhone.\n\nHope you enjoy and please leave comments, thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d44440af5b0f00059fb1a939e5428120180f52","amp;dn":"SOLARSTONE+-+PURE+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d44440af5b0f00059fb1a939e5428120180f52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,212,68,64,175,91,15,0,5,159,177,169,57,229,66,129,32,24,15,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
