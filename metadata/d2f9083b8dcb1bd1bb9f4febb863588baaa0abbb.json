Albert is hard working and saves his money so that one day he will be able to eke out a better life for himself by owning his own business rather than work at the hotel. Beyond his work colleagues, he is all alone in the world. One day, a man named Hubert Page is hired by Mrs. Baker to paint one of the rooms in the hotel. She forces Hubert to share AlbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bed for the one night he is required to stay to complete the work, much to AlbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horror. Hubert discovers the reason Albert did not want to share a room with him. But rather than the issue being a problem, Hubert shows Albert that he can follow a slightly different life path than the one he envisioned for himself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one closer to the life that Hubert leads with his wife CathleenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 6.6/10 from 4,868 users\nDirected by: Rodrigo GarcÃƒÂ­a\nStarring: Glenn Close, Mia Wasikowska and Aaron Johnson\n\nRelease Name: Albert.Nobbs.2011.DVDRip.XviD-KAZAN\nSize: 1,36 GB\nVideo: XviD, 720 x 296, 1348 kbps\nAudio: English, AC3, 448 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 48m 44s\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f9083b8dcb1bd1bb9f4febb863588baaa0abbb","amp;dn":"Albert.Nobbs.2011.DVDRip.XviD-KAZAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f9083b8dcb1bd1bb9f4febb863588baaa0abbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,249,8,59,141,203,27,209,187,159,79,235,184,99,88,139,170,160,171,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
