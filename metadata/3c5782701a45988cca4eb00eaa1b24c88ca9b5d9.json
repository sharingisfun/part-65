Violence and war spread across Europe and the world, and as new technology trumped old it became possible to harm others on a previously unimaginable scale.\n\nIn this turbulent age, a new breed of thinker emerged who would examine what drives humanity. And the advent of television gave psychologists and scientists the chance to preach their ideas to the world\n\nThis programme mines the BBC archive to hear the great minds of the 20th century in their own words - the likes of Sigmund Freud, Margaret Mead, BF Skinner, Benjamin Spock and Richard Dawkins. The film also reveals some unseen gems, such as unseen footage from Panorama of the psychologist Carl Jung discussing his torturous relationship with Professor Freud.\n\nFeaturing contributions from modern-day scientists such as evolutionary biologist Professor Armand Leroi, broadcasting legend Sir David Attenborough and psychologist Oliver James, this is a unique opportunity to hear some of the most famous thinkers of our times.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c5782701a45988cca4eb00eaa1b24c88ca9b5d9","amp;dn":"Great+Thinkers+in+Their+Own+Words++%28BBC+2011+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c5782701a45988cca4eb00eaa1b24c88ca9b5d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,87,130,112,26,69,152,140,202,78,176,14,170,27,36,200,140,169,181,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
