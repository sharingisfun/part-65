The game has a post-apocalyptic setting in the mid-22nd century, featuring an alternate history which deviates some time after World War II, where technology, politics and culture followed a different course.\n\nGameplay in Fallout consists of traveling around the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants. Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points. Fallout deviates from most computer role-playing games in that it often allows for the player to complete tasks in multiple ways, often choosing solutions that are unconventional or even contrary to the original task, in which case the player may still be rewarded. The player's actions may ultimately dictate the ending of the game, or what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. \n\nContains:\n-Fallout 1\n-Fallout 2\n\nThey are in zip format so unzip and play its as simple as that happy gaming\n\nIf you Have any questions please comment and SEED WHEN YOU DONE!
