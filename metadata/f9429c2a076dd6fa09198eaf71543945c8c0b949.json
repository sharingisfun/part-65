The film charts Guetta's constant documenting of his every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist Invader, to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on Shepard Fairey and Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice, to Guetta's eventual fame as a street artist himself. The film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival on 24 January, 2010. It is narrated by Rhys Ifans. The music is by Geoff Barrow. It includes Richard Hawley's &quot;Tonight The Streets Are Ours&quot;.[1] The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 83rd Academy Awards, and broadcast on Channel 4 on August 13, 2011. \nlanguage is Russian only! no subs. :(  DVDrip.\n\nÃ‚Â«Ãâ€™Ã‘â€¹Ã‘â€¦ÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ Ã‘â€¡ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂµÃÂ· Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ¸Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ½Ã‘Æ’Ã‘Å½ ÃÂ»ÃÂ°ÃÂ²ÃÂºÃ‘Æ’Ã‚Â» (ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ³ÃÂ».
