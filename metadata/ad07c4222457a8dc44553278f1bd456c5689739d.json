Maya is knocked into the water and eaten. The shark then damages the steering column of the boat. It crashes into the gas pump in front of the boathouse, exploding and stranding everyone. Sara, Nick and Malik barely make it to shore. Because their cell phones have no reception and the house has no landline, they \ncannot call for help.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad07c4222457a8dc44553278f1bd456c5689739d","amp;dn":"SHARK+NIGHT+3D+2011+RMVB+CAM+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad07c4222457a8dc44553278f1bd456c5689739d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,7,196,34,36,87,168,220,68,85,50,120,241,189,69,108,86,137,115,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
