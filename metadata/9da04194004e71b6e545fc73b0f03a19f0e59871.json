Other titles in the series are The 100 Most Influential Inventors of All Time, The 100 Most Influential Painters &amp; Sculptors of the Renaissance, The 100 Most Influential Philosophers of All Time, The 100 Most Influential Scientists of All Time, The 100 Most Influential Women of All Time, The 100 Most Influential World Leadersof All Time, and The 100 Most Influential Writers of All Time. The editors are Britannica contributors or editors. The intended audience is grades 9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“12. The titles in the Britannica Guide to the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Most Influential People series are arranged chronologically. For example, The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time begins with medieval music theorist Guido dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Arezzo and ends with Jay-Z. Overall, the selections offer a good balance of gender, nationality, and ethnicity. Articles, a mix of new content and content drawn from BritannicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repository, generally range from two to five pages and are headed with date and place of birth and, where applicable, death. There are no article-specific bibliographies or references. Each volume concludes with a glossary, a brief further-reading list, and an index. Although not visually enticing, these volumes offer trustworthy information in convenient packages and would be useful in high-school and public libraries. Other series resulting from the Rosen-Britannica partnership include America at War, An ExplorerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to the Universe, Islamic History, Turning Points in History, and U. S. Government: The Separation of Powers, with more to come.
