PRL featured short, important papers from all branches of physics, and quickly assumed a place among the most prestigious publications in any scientific discipline. Today PRL is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s foremost physics letters journal, providing rapid publication of short reports of significant fundamental research in all fields of physics. International in scope, the journal provides its diverse readership with weekly coverage of major advances in physics and cross disciplinary developments. PRL\\'s topical sections are devoted to general physics (including statistical and quantum mechanics, quantum information, etc.), gravitation and astrophysics; elementary particles and fields; nuclear physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics, classical optics; plasma and beam physics; condensed matter; and soft-matter, biological, and interdisciplinary physics. \n\n=====================================================\n\nPhysical Review Letters 1994- 1996","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0b803bf6e443854856067efea0e91b8dd6b7932","amp;dn":"APS-+Physical+Review+Letters+1994-+1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0b803bf6e443854856067efea0e91b8dd6b7932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,184,3,191,110,68,56,84,133,96,103,239,234,14,145,184,221,107,121,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
