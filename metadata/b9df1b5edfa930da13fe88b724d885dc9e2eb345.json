More rare games to come soon, stay tuned. This game is called Warcommander, published by CDV and developed by Independent Arts back in 2002. A good strategy game with no resource gathering. You start with a handful of troops and you must accomplish your mission with them, using the special capabilities of each unit. Utah and Omaha campaigns will keep you busy for long enough. Unzip the file, run setup, copy the crack to the directory where you installed the game and play! Cheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9df1b5edfa930da13fe88b724d885dc9e2eb345","amp;dn":"warcommander","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9df1b5edfa930da13fe88b724d885dc9e2eb345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,223,27,94,223,169,48,218,19,254,136,183,36,216,133,220,158,46,179,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
