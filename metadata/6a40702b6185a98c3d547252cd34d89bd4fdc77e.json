This documentary takes the audience through the treacherous, yet victorious, 14-year journey both Dr. Burzynski and his patients have had to endure in order to obtain FDA-approved clinical trials of Antineoplastons.\n\n\nCancer Is Curable Now:\nCANCER is curable NOW. However it is NOT cured with medicine and drugs, but with KNOWLEDGE! &quot;CANCER is curable NOW&quot; is the breakthrough that brings alternative cancer treatment to the mainstream. This Feature Length Documentary Will Bring Millions Of People To Alternative Cancer Treatments.\n\nThis documentary pulls together more than 30 international holistic professionals who have been working passionately in the field of cancer alternatives Ã¢â‚¬â€ doctors, scientists, researchers and writers from around the world. You've probably heard about many of them in books and on TV, but if you'd like to see their knowledge distilled into a 90 min firework of insights, this movie is the place to do it.\n\nThe almost two-hour movie is very professionally done with some great 3D animations and some sad but true cartoons to lighten things up.
