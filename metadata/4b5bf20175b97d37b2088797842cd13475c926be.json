It is a remake of Counter-Strike, the 1999 modification of Half-Life. Built on the Source engine, the game was released in 2004 along with Half-Life 2. The game is the most played Half-Life 2 mod, according to GameSpy.\n\nAs in the original version, Counter-Strike: Source games pit a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing a mission (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the opposing team. Unlike Half-Life: Source, the game is a complete remake instead of a port with additional content.\t\n\nSystem Requirements:\n====================\n\nMinimum: 1.7 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM, DirectX 8.1 level Graphics Card (Requires support for SSE), Windows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\n\nRecommended: Pentium 4 processor (3.0GHz, or better), 1GB RAM, DirectX 9 level Graphics Card, Windows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\n\nlanguage\n==========\n\nRussian \n\nInstallation:\n=============\n\nTo install game use: Setup.exe\nChange nick use in game-console: setname &quot;your name&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b5bf20175b97d37b2088797842cd13475c926be","amp;dn":"Counter_Strike_Sourcev1.0.0.70.1.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b5bf20175b97d37b2088797842cd13475c926be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,91,242,1,117,185,125,55,178,8,135,151,132,44,209,52,117,201,38,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
