Front man Rick DeJesus explains &quot;We set the bar so high on this record; we really tried to outdo ourselves&quot;. The 11-track album definitely achieves the type of &quot;next level&quot; sound the band strived for. Singles &quot;Sick&quot;, &quot;The Collapse&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot; are loaded with heavy guitar riffs layered under the intense unrivaled sound of DeJesus' lead vocals. The rockers' 2009 self-titled debut album gained major traction with singles &quot;Scream&quot; featured in the fi lm Saw 3D, rock anthem &quot;Invincible&quot; becoming the theme song for WWE\nSuperstars, and acquiring a sync in the finale of CBS's hit series &quot;CSI: Miami&quot;. For Adelitas Way, the last two years have been nothing short of amazing, as the band prepares to release their sophomore album, they'll be hitting the road with the Carnival of Madness Tour starting this June and continuing for most of the summer. Home School Valedictorian was recorded in 2010 at Malibu's Chateau Relaxo Studio, the album was produced by Dave Bassett (Shinedown, Josh Groban, Halestorm) and engineered by Tadpole (Disturbed, Finger Eleven).\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.The collapse                                         [03:38]\n02.Sick                                                 [03:12]\n03.Alive                                                [03:47]\n04.Criticize                                            [03:02]\n05.Good enough                                          [03:51]\n06.Cage the beast                                       [03:17]\n07.I can tell                                           [03:39]\n08.Somebody wishes they were you                        [03:44]\n09.Move                                                 [03:21]\n10.I wanna be                                           [03:13]\n11.Hurt                                                 [03:57]\n____\n\n38:41 min\n 64,6 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
