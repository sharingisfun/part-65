Subsequently, monstrous\ncreatures have risen from the watery depths of the sea and their attacks\nhave brought all seafaring to a grinding halt. The hero, now a member of the\nInquisition, is sent out to find out how to stop the chaos caused by these\ncreatures from the deep. His quest begins with rumors that the pirates who\nfrequent the southern islands are the only ones who know a way to get rid of\nthe creatures once and for all and end their reign of terror.\n\nWith an all-new pirate-based theme, Risen 2: Dark Waters aims to combine the\nmost loved classic RPG gameplay mechanics of the original Risen with a fresh\ntheme and setting on a huge variety of themed island locales.

These choices will serve to unlock new paths,\nfeatures and additional skills for the character. Together with a highly\ninteractive environment and a full day/night-cycle affecting countless\naspects of the game world, Risen 2 will be set in the most immersive RPG\ngame world so far.\n\n\n1.
