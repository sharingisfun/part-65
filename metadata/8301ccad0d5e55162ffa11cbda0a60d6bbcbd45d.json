Naturally, her parents are searching for a wealthy, well-appointed husband to assure their daughter's future social standing. They are eyeing Mr. Wisley, nephew to the very formidable, not to mention very rich, local aristocrat Lady Gresham, as a prospective match. But when Jane meets the roguish and decidedly non-aristocratic Tom Lefroy, sparks soon fly along with the sharp repartee. His intellect and arrogance raise her ire - then knock her head over heels. Now, the couple, whose flirtation flies in the face of the sense and sensibility of the age, is faced with a terrible dilemma. If they attempt to marry, they will risk everything that matters - family, friends and fortune.\n\nDirector: Julian Jarrold\nWriters: Jane Austen (letters), Kevin Hood\nStars: Anne Hathaway, James McAvoy and Julie Walters\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416508/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416508/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRUNTiME.........: 02h:00m:59s\nSiZE............: 7.77 GB\nViDEO CODEC.....: x264, 2pass, L4.1\nFRAMERATE.......: 23.976fps\nViDEO BiTRATE...: 8500 Kbps\nRESOLUTiON......: 1920x816\nAUDiO...........: AC-3 5.1 English @ 640 kbps\nSUBTiTLE........: eng, eng sdh, chi SRT\nSOURCE..........: Becoming Jane 2007 1080p Blu-ray VC-1 LPCM 5.1(thx raphaex)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8301ccad0d5e55162ffa11cbda0a60d6bbcbd45d","amp;dn":"Becoming.Jane.2007.1080p.BluRay.x264-CtrlHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8301ccad0d5e55162ffa11cbda0a60d6bbcbd45d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,1,204,173,13,94,85,22,47,250,17,203,218,10,96,214,187,203,212,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
