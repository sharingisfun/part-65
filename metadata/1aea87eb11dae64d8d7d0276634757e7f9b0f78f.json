There is a story mode / training mode and a 2 player vs mode. In a nut shell, alienÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attack the last city on earth. The big robot comes up, and here is where the twist come in, you have to control the robot from the perspective of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œheroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (three to choose from) and you can switch between the robot / hero mode. This forces you to make sure you have a strategic position to move the hero around in the city to see the battle without getting too close. As the game goes on you have the option to update/customize the mech(s) to improve them. You can end up destroying whole building / terrain as you battle the alien monster. \n\nPrepare to bond with 75 tons of high-tensile robot. Direct every movement of your machine and slug your way to victory over colossal opponents in brutal hand-to-hand combat (plus missiles, lasers, shooting fists, boomerangs, and much more). Freeway overpass in the way? Take it down. Buildings crowding you? Knock 'em over. \n\nMuch more than a simple action game, Robot Alchemic Drive accurately simulates the operation of a remote-controlled metal titan in crowded, active urban environments. Use your giant robot as a tool to defeat enemies, complete missions, and much more. Treat your robot well and you will be rewarded. Abuse your robot and, well, you'll wish you hadn't.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Concurrent gameplay occurs on two levels: The Robot plane and the human plane. \n\n* Unique control mechanism simulates remote control of huge robots.\n\n* Robots can transform into an alternate form.\n\n* Fully usable/destructible environments - if you see it, you can crush it, stomp \n  on it, knock it down. Head up to the top of a skyscraper to view the action.\n\n* Intense graphics bring crammed urban cities to life. Classically designed robots \n  move/transform realistically.\n\n* Innovative design enables incredible sense of scale.\n\n* R&amp;D system enables customization and enhancement of robots.\n\n* Story-driven gameplay provides depth lacking in other &quot;giant robot&quot; titles. \n\n* Character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto of hit Anime &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nPics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aea87eb11dae64d8d7d0276634757e7f9b0f78f","amp;dn":"R.A.D.+Robot+Alchemic+Drive+%5BDVD+Build%5D+%5BNTSC%5D+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aea87eb11dae64d8d7d0276634757e7f9b0f78f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,234,135,235,17,218,230,77,141,125,2,118,99,71,87,231,249,176,247,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
