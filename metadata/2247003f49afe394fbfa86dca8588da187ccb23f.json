Written by Alan Ayckbourn; Full-cast dramatisation.\n\nWhat's the most important thing for composer Jerome: a great new work, or his family?\n\nIt's sometime in the near future. Composer Jerome has been suffering a creative block. His only company is his beloved music, the ultra-modern recording devices that surround him, and a malfunctioning humanoid robot, NAN 300F.\n\nJerome has been unable to work since his wife, Corinna, left with their daughter Geain 4 years ago. Desperate to see Geain again and hoping she'll release the flood-gates, he engages a young actress, Zoe, to pretend to be his fiancee. He wants to deceive his ex-wife into believing he's a fit person to be allowed to spend time with Geain. But, owing to his obsession with recording every intimate moment, Zoe quits. Can Jerome now re-programme robot Nan to sound and look like perfect Zoe? And what is most important to Jerome - writing the perfect piece of music on the subject of love - or being back with his family? Life or Art? Plus - which is better - a robot or a human being?\n\nJerome ..... Jared Harris\nLupus ..... Simon Templeman\nZoe ..... Sophie Winkleman\nGeain, aged 9 ..... Rosa Calcraft\nCorinna .....
