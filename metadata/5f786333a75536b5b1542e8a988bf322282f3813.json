You can hear a few drop outs on the fidelity but those are defects from the VHS. For the most part its a pristine rip. This was one of my first rips I did years ago and was surprised that I didn't overboost the wave format. It was left it a little low on the DB so it wouldn't get that &quot;digital compression&quot; feel. Loved the drumming. Art was just one of very few pics of the VHS cover on the net.\n\nIf your a drumming fan - I think You'll enjoy\n\n\n\nAll rights reserved to (the/any of) copyright holders.
