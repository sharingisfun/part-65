But when his gearhead son Wyatt can't stop fighting with her green-minded daughter Chloe, they realize that this new family may not make it. And things aren't just stormy on the home front; when an unidentified object is shot down by the military and crashes into Puget Sound, it sets off a series of strange weather phenomena: earthquakes, tornados, lightning storms... and they're spreading. Now, this new family must find a way to work together to save the city, and each other, before it's too late. \n\nSCREENS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Zxc1g.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Zxc1g.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51e9abd0e30f2f83a4cc3eabfe6cc69adfffd523","amp;dn":"Seattle.Superstorm.2012.480p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-XTREME","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51e9abd0e30f2f83a4cc3eabfe6cc69adfffd523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,233,171,208,227,15,47,131,164,204,62,171,254,108,198,154,223,255,213,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
