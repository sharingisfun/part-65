The 31 papers, presented together with 2 invited talks, were carefully reviewed and selected from 167 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections on lattice-base cryptography, implementation and side channels, homomorphic cryptography, signature schemes, information-theoretic cryptography, symmetric key cryptography, attacks and algorithms, secure computation, composability, key dependent message security, and public key encryption.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc977677c887bcda9099debf98ebbfa1e41598df","amp;dn":"Advances+In+Cryptology+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+EUROCRYPT+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc977677c887bcda9099debf98ebbfa1e41598df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,151,118,119,200,135,188,218,144,153,222,191,152,235,191,161,228,21,152,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
