Beginnings followed the \ncomics almost page for page, with a few exceptions of removed contentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for instance it removed \nall non-movie Transformers such as Arcee and Swindle. \nArcee still appears in a non speaking role.\n\nPlease Note: This is a video comic, not a full animated feature, it is a \nprequel to the 1st Live action movie and explains the events leading to \nBumblebee finding Sam Whitwickey and the trail of the Allspark. \n\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nStory\n-------\nOptimus Prime and Lord High Protector Megatron rule Cybertron, protecting the Allspark, an enormous cube of energy that gave life to the Transformers. However, Megatron secretly desires the Allspark's power for himself and has formed a like-minded army of separatists -the Decepticons - with Starscream at his side. He then plunges Cybertron into civil war, killing millions. During the Battle of Tyger Pax, Autobot Bumblebee leads a team to hold back \noverwhelming odds of Dreadwing, Payload and Swindle Drones while Prime attempts to launch the Allspark into space, making a last-ditch attempt to prevent Megatron from claiming it. \nThe Decepticons capture Bumblebee and torture him. Bumblebee keeps Megatron distracted long enough for the Allspark to be launched into space. A determined Megatron flies into space to find it, but not before punishing Bumblebee by crushing his voice processor. \nAfter finding a way to tell Prime and the other Autobots of Megatron's plan, Bumblebee is among the first to volunteer to find it before he does.\n\nMegatron, keeping a close psychic bond with the Allspark, soon locates it on Earth. Heating up during entry into the atmosphere, he crashes and sinks under the Arctic ice sheets. The sudden temperature drop and loss of energon forces him into stasis lock. \nIn 1897, the National Arctic Circle Expedition headed by Captain Archibald Witwicky discovers Megatron frozen solid, and accidentally reactivates the Decepticon's navigational system. The location of the Allspark is burned into Captain Witwicky's glasses, blinding him and eventually driving him insane. At the Boston Secure Hospital, the government takes great interest in his story and the Sector 7 group begins excavating for Megatron, codenamed the &quot;Ice-man&quot;. In 1902, the Allspark is discovered to be in the Colorado River, and by 1935, work begins on the Hoover Dam over it with plans to move Megatron there.\n\nIn 2003, Bumblebee lands on Mars before landing in Virginia, and takes up the form of a 1976 Chevrolet Camaro. Designated N.B.E - 2, he avoids Sector 7's gaze, forcing Agent Simmons to step up an operation to capture him. Bumblebee begins finding information on Captain Witwicky, and Sector 7 attempts to spring a trap with a replica Allspark. Starscream, Blackout and Barricade follow suit, destroying the Beagle 2 Mars rover in the process. They scan and destroy vehicles and defeat Sector 7's trap. They let Bumblebee escape as they know he can lead them to the Allspark. Elsewhere, Sam Witwicky is given his ancestor's glasses. A Target Corporation-exclusive follow-up shows Bumblebee tracking down Sam by checking outside Archibald's asylum and looking for his son, Clarence, to Springfield, Missouri, where he learns of his son Herbert, his six children and starts to look for each, one-by-one. All the while he is being followed by Sector 7 and Barricade.\n\nh**p://www.imdb.com/title/tt1236486/\n\nSpoken Language: English\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVoice Cast\n------------\nPeter Cullen as Optimus Prime \nFrank Welker as Megatron \nMark Ryan as Bumblebee \nPatrick Hallahan as Starscream / Additional Voices \nBrian Stepanek as Blackout / Agent Reggie Simmons \nKevin Dunn as Ron Witwicky \nPatrick Viall as Captain Archibald Witwicky / Additional Voices \nHarold Hayes, Jr. as Bald Sector 7 Agent \nJustin Foley as Additional Voices \nKenny Luper as Additional Voices \nRyan Pfeiffer as Additional Voices \nUnknown voice actors voice Sam, Barricade and Epps\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nScreenshots\n-------------\n\n[URL=http://img17.imageshack.us/i/transformersbeginnings2.jpg/][IMG]http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9321/transformersbeginnings2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:22:05.458\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 39724\nVideoBitRate       : 968634\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nHash\n------\nCF26E3FB83F90DF4474171E994DF1A986FB24F3D\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf26e3fb83f90df4474171e994df1a986fb24f3d","amp;dn":"Transformers+Beginnings+2007+DVDRip-%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf26e3fb83f90df4474171e994df1a986fb24f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,38,227,251,131,249,13,244,71,65,113,233,148,223,26,152,111,178,79,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
