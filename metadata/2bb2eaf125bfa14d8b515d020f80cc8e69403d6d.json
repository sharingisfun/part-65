Now, four years later, they've honed their songwriting and on-stage magic, but they've also evolved into a band with a very clear purpose: &quot;If we could sum up our mission as a band, it would be to address the deeper questions regarding life and spirituality, while offering very real hope,&quot; says Caley. &quot;While recording new, thoughtful music is part of that, our favorite part is to pack it all in a van and hit the road in an effort to meet and interact with as many people as possible.&quot;\n\nAnd that's exactly what they've done for the last few years. While touring the country from New Hampshire to Nebraska, Ohio to Oklahoma, playing high-energy shows and spreading their message of acceptance and hope, Attaboy recorded and self-released a full-length album, So Much for Today, in July 2007, and worked with Ian Eskelin (Stellar Kart, Everyday Sunday, Eleventyseven) to produce a four-song EP, California, in April 2008.\n\nThe band's progressive guitar and piano-driven sound won't merely get stuck in the listener's head; with the tenacity of a still, small voice, it will edge its way into the heart.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bb2eaf125bfa14d8b515d020f80cc8e69403d6d","amp;dn":"Attaboy+Discography+2007-2010+%285+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bb2eaf125bfa14d8b515d020f80cc8e69403d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,178,234,241,37,191,161,77,139,81,93,2,15,128,204,142,105,64,61,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
