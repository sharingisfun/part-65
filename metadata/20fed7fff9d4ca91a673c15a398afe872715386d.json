What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 8 - Wednesday - It's time to get back to basics with a homely team cooking challenge. Separated into three teams, they are invited into a suburban home, where they must cook for two neighbours. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20fed7fff9d4ca91a673c15a398afe872715386d","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E46.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20fed7fff9d4ca91a673c15a398afe872715386d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,254,215,255,249,212,202,145,166,115,193,90,57,138,254,135,39,21,56,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
