I have also added some of my personal comments as FYI.\n\n\nAutodesk Revit DB Link 2012 \nImport and export data between an AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Architecture 2012, AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Structure 2012, or AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MEP 2012 project and an external database, and then more easily maintain relationships of linked data with AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® DB Link.\n\nA grid view of the data enables you to make any final edits before import.\nDatabases can be updated following internal or external changes.\nThe grid control enables you to create Revit shared parameters to add new fields to related tables in the database.\nChanges to new fields within the database automatically update Revit shared parameters upon future imports.\n\nAutodesk Revit Model Review 2012 \n\nAutomate the process of reviewing and auditing building information modeling (BIM) projects in AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Architecture 2012, AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MEP 2012, or AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Structure 2012 software with the AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Model Review plug-in:\n\nCheck the accuracy and consistency of a Project or Family against standards set by your firm, your clients, or industry best practices.\nCorrect inconsistencies with a single click or with instructions provided when manual fixes are required.\n\n\nWorksharing Monitor for Autodesk Revit 2012 \n\nWorksharing Monitor facilitates the use of AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Architecture 2012, AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Structure 2012, or AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MEP 2012 software in a worksharing environment, in which multiple people work on one project. For workshared projects, Worksharing Monitor answers questions such as:\n\nWho is currently working on this project?\nIs my local copy of the project up-to-date?\nWhen will my Save to Central operation finish?\nHas my request to borrow elements been granted?\nAre any issues interfering with my work on a Revit software project?\n\n\nSpace Naming Utility for Autodesk Revit MEP 2012 \nThe Space Naming Utility for AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MEP 2012 software is an intuitive tool that automatically assigns the names and numbers from architectural rooms to Revit MEP spaces. By downloading the Space Naming Utility for Revit MEP 2012 software, you can eliminate the need to manually assign names to the spaces, helping save time and simplifying your workflow.\n\n\nGlobe Link for Autodesk Revit 2012 \n\nWith Globe Link, users can publish 3D building information models directly from AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Architecture 2012, AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Structure 2012, and AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MEP 2012 software into Google EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ mapping service. Users can also acquire site information from Google Earth mapping service and import it into Revit 2012 software applications for building and site layout purposes.\n\n\nBatch Print for Autodesk Revit 2012\n\nBatch Print provides an easy way to print a large number of drawings (views and sheets) from a AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Architecture 2012, AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Structure 2012, or AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RevitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MEP 2012 software project. \nAfter preparing the default printer and the Revit software project, use Batch Print to send any number of drawings to the printer and to control the order in which they print. When you start the print job, Batch Print manages the printing of the drawings, requiring no further interaction from you. If desired, you can monitor the progress of the print job using a status dialog.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65b34d971e86a7f4f3bc52d3b9cab468643bae82","amp;dn":"AutoDesk+Revit+2012+Subscription+Add+ons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65b34d971e86a7f4f3bc52d3b9cab468643bae82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,179,77,151,30,134,167,244,243,188,82,211,185,202,180,104,100,59,174,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
