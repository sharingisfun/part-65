That's a pretty big cliffhanger to end on. However, the cliff only hangs so long. While the 2nd Mass is involved in a fierce firefight with an alien patrol they've ambushed, guess who comes wandering back into the group (and also into the line of his son Ben's fire)? If you said Tom, you'd be right! Disregarding his brother Hal's orders, Ben promptly shoots his returning father, ostensibly by mistake. Happy Father's Day, Tom! Welcome back and here's a bullet for your troubles!\n\n\nDetails\n********\n\nTitle: Falling Skies S02E01 HDTV x264-ASAP\nTotal episode for the season:10\nProducer : Steven Spielperg\nCreator: Robert Rodat\nStars:Maxim Knight, Sarah Carter and Noah Wyle \nGenres:Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller \nCountry:USA | Canada \nLanguage:English \nSubs :External Greek Subs\n\nRatings: 8.6/10 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13c75cc1b99c71e06be533ba9b371902959252b","amp;dn":"Falling+Skies+S02E01+HDTV+x264-ASAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13c75cc1b99c71e06be533ba9b371902959252b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,60,117,204,27,153,199,30,6,190,83,59,169,179,113,144,41,89,37,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
