Yeo-ri chooses to isolate herself from the outside world but is approached by a street magician named Jo-goo (Lee Min-ki), who offers her a job in his show.\n\nOne year passes, and Yeo-ri ends up playing a part in the magicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horror-themed act, in which she plays a ghost in a closet. Every day, Jo-gooÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staff successfully close the show and invite Yeo-ri for drinks, but she always rejects their offer. She is fully aware what will happen if she gets close to people.\nWhen eventually Yeo-ri opens up to Jo-goo about her tragic and lonely life, things start to change for the both of them. Can Jo-Goo help her find a way out? Or will he be chased away by the ghosts like all of the other people in Yeo-riÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life?\n\nRELEASE DATE....: 05/10/2012\nTHEATRE DATE....: 2011\niMDB URL........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2132405\niMDB RATiNG.....: 6.9/10 130 votes\nGENRE...........: Romance\nSOURCE .........: Spellbound 2011 BluRay 1080p AVC DTS-HD MA5.1\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 L4.1 High @ 4002 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\nAUDiO 1.........: Korean DTS-HDMA core 5.1 1509Kbps\nRUNTiME.........: 1:53:19 (h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.844 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1280 X 694\nSUBTiTLES.......: N/A\nFilE SiZE.......: 4.36G\nENCODER.........: youlong@CHD\n\nx264frame I:1637 Avg QP:14.41 size: 95362\nx264frame P:34688 Avg QP:15.54 size: 33938\nx264frame B:126684 Avg QP:16.70 size: 16295\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LVhVm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LVhVm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eXAwM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eXAwM.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Be1sn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Be1sn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fDPsR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fDPsR.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f788760185d8c557077f396e3884a0359a5b7262","amp;dn":"Spellbound.2011.BluRay.720p.DTS.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f788760185d8c557077f396e3884a0359a5b7262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,136,118,1,133,216,197,87,7,127,57,110,56,132,160,53,154,91,114,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
