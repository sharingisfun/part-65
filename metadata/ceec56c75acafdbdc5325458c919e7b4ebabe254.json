Graf did not lose a set during the tournament and lost a total of only 29 games.\n \nGraf lost twice to Gabriela Sabatini during the spring, once on hardcourts in Boca Raton, Florida, and once on clay at Amelia Island, Florida. Graf, however, won the tournament in San Antonio, Texas and retained her title in Miami, where she once again defeated Evert in the final. Graf then won the tournament in Berlin, losing only twelve games in five matches.\n \nAt the French Open, Graf successfully defended her title by defeating Natasha Zvereva 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0, 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0 in a 32-minute final.[11] That was the first double bagel in a Grand Slam final since 1911.[11] Zvereva, who had eliminated Martina Navratilova in the fourth round, won only thirteen points in the match.[11]\n \nNext came Wimbledon, where Navratilova had won six straight titles. Graf was trailing Navratilova in the final 7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5, 2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0 before winning the match 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ7, 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2, 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1. She then won tournaments in Hamburg and Mahwah (where she lost only eight games all tournament).\n \nAt the US Open, Graf defeated Sabatini in a three-set final to win the Calendar Year Grand Slam, a feat previously performed by only two other women, Maureen Connolly Brinker in 1953 and Margaret Court in 1970.\n \nGraf then defeated Sabatini 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3, 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3 in the gold medal match at the Olympic Games in Seoul and achieved what the media had dubbed the &quot;Golden Slam&quot;.\n \nGraf also won her only Grand Slam doubles title that yearÃ¢â‚¬â€at Wimbledon partnering SabatiniÃ¢â‚¬â€and picked up a women's doubles Olympic bronze medal.\n \nAt the year-ending Virginia Slims Championships, Graf Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hampered by illness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was upset by Pam Shriver, only her third loss of the year. She was named the 1988 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceec56c75acafdbdc5325458c919e7b4ebabe254","amp;dn":"1988+Australian+Open+Final+Steffi+Graf+vs+Chris+Evert.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceec56c75acafdbdc5325458c919e7b4ebabe254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,236,86,199,90,202,253,189,197,50,84,88,201,25,231,180,235,171,226,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
