In this, the fourth installment of the long-running action series, Underworld director Len Wiseman picks up the torch formerly carried by directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin to helm a script penned by Mark Bomback. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 9 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 304\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af90ef681cd24d798a8e03d30f9a9e85c0bd41f4","amp;dn":"Live+Free+or+Die+Hard%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af90ef681cd24d798a8e03d30f9a9e85c0bd41f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,144,239,104,28,210,77,121,138,142,3,211,15,154,158,133,192,189,65,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
