DeHaan plays Andrew, a angsty teen whose mother is dying and whose father takes out his violent frustrations out on the boy. As a result, Andrew starts filming everything around him, including the dreadful night that he, his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) and the soon-to-be senior class president, Steve (Michael B. Jordan), wake up with superpowers after exploring a condemned piece of land housing an unexplained power source. The three bond over their newfound abilities, with Andrew clearly leading the pack in terms of control and strength. Despite their noble intentions, a darker streak appears in one of them as the other two try to take control over a situation that soon spirals into homicidal madness -- all of which is captured on camera.\n\nRipped with Autogk\n\nLength: 1 Hour 24 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 640\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 126kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c1d49c4c8f52c0856c15e253469662c6bbc960","amp;dn":"Chronicle%282012%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c1d49c4c8f52c0856c15e253469662c6bbc960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,193,212,156,76,143,82,192,133,108,21,226,83,70,150,98,198,187,201,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
