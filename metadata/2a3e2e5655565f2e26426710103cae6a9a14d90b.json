Tommy narrowly escapes with his life and loses both Forelli's money and the cocaine.[7]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a3e2e5655565f2e26426710103cae6a9a14d90b","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+Vice+City+PAL%2FNTSC+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a3e2e5655565f2e26426710103cae6a9a14d90b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,62,46,86,85,86,95,46,38,66,103,16,16,60,174,106,154,20,217,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
