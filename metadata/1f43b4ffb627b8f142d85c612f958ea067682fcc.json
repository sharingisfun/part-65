Some advocate heaving-to, others running off. Some say trail a sea anchor over the bow, others a drogue astern. The stakes in the discussion couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be higher, or the consensus lower. Finally, preeminent sailor/author Hal Roth offers a practical strategy that can evolve and respond as storms grow stronger.\nAbout the Author\n\nHal Roth has sailed twice around the world single-handed. He has crossed the Pacific five times, the Atlantic 11 times, and has rounded Cape Horn three times, logging more than 200,000 miles under sail. He is the author of 10 books of high adventure and some 400 articles for sailing magazines.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 288 pages\n    * Publisher: International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press; 1 edition (October 27, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0071496483\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0071496483","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f43b4ffb627b8f142d85c612f958ea067682fcc","amp;dn":"Handling+Storms+at+Sea+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f43b4ffb627b8f142d85c612f958ea067682fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,67,180,255,182,39,184,241,66,216,92,97,47,149,142,160,103,104,47,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
