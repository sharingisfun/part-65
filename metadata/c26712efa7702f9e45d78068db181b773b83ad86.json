Why does this condition affect so many people in the industrialized world, while in some countries only 5% of adults report back pain? In a quest to find the root cause of back pain, Esther Gokhale studied at the Aplomb Institute in Paris and traveled to parts of the world where back pain is virtually unknown. Her research took her to remote Burkina Faso, rural Portugal, and fishing villages in Brazil.\n\nWhat she learned in each of these places has changed the lives of thousands of people. Preserved in the movements of weavers, millers, and farmers in more traditional societies is ancient body wisdom that prevents pain and enhances health. For the first time, these insights have been brought together in a step-by-step guide designed to help those suffering from back pain re-educate their bodies and regain the posture for which our bodies evolved.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c26712efa7702f9e45d78068db181b773b83ad86","amp;dn":"8+Steps+to+a+Pain-Free+Back%3A+Natural+Posture+Solutions+for+Pain+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c26712efa7702f9e45d78068db181b773b83ad86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,103,18,239,167,112,47,158,69,215,128,104,219,24,27,119,59,131,173,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
