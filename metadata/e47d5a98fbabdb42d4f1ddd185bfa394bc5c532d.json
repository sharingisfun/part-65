Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier; these come from being raised by her father (Bana), an ex-CIA man, in the wilds of Finland. Living a life unlike any other teenager, her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin. The turning point in her adolescence is a sharp one; sent into the world by her father on a mission, Hanna journeys stealthily across Europe while eluding agents dispatched after her by a ruthless intelligence operative with secrets of her own (Ms. Blanchett). As she nears her ultimate target, Hanna faces startling revelations about her existence and unexpected questions about her humanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47d5a98fbabdb42d4f1ddd185bfa394bc5c532d","amp;dn":"Hanna+2011+Custom+Dvd++Spanish+Latino","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47d5a98fbabdb42d4f1ddd185bfa394bc5c532d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,125,90,152,251,171,219,66,212,241,221,209,133,191,163,148,188,92,83,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
