See the full list for an upcoming broadcast near you.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is Where We Take Our StandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the story of hundreds of veterans who risked everything to publicly tell their accounts of the horrors they witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In March of 2008, two hundred and fifty veterans and active-duty soldiers marked the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq by gathering in Washington, DC, to testify from their own experience about the nature of the occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. It was chilling, horrifying, and challenging for all who witnessed it.\n\nAgainst tremendous odds, they brought the voices of the veterans themselves into the debate. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is Where We Take Our StandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the inside story of those three days and the courageous men and women who testified-a story thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as important to tell today as ever.\n\nThese brave soldiers and veterans are challenging a public silence that runs very deep, underscoring a willingness to accept unspeakable horrors-as long as we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about them.\n\nmore info:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thisiswherewetakeourstand.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thisiswherewetakeourstand.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrailer: \n\nYou can also watch this documentary on Youtube here:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]Technical Specs[/b]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nType: mp4 file\nSize: 242MB\nRuntime: 01:03:43\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x360\nAudio: AAC 44100Hz stereo 96Kbps \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bf4a67a873fecae66efb8bdf08a361563cd24d6","amp;dn":"This+Is+Where+We+Take+Our+Stand+%282011%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bf4a67a873fecae66efb8bdf08a361563cd24d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,244,166,122,135,63,236,174,102,239,184,189,240,138,54,21,99,205,36,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
