The first two had problems. The second one seemed fine until it was downloaded and it failed to play correctly and got hung up for an unknown reason. I trust I have the problem now fixed.

Thank You.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFrom the Uploader:\n\nThis album original came out in 1976 followed by the smash live double album Live Bullet which made Bob Seger a household name. I must give thanks for the PB member: oldiesguy8898 for uploading the larger wave file of this which is only 373.72 Megs in size - See http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/377665/Bob_Seger_and_the_Silver_Bullet_Band_-_Night_Moves_%28DCC_Gold_Dis\nHe made this upload possible as all I did was to reduce the file size from Wave to Flac. However I did use the highest quality of Flac my converter would allow me to use and should be a smaller file with no loss of audio quality.\n\nTo Convert Flac to Audio CD, Mp3, ACC ETC: Download the Free Mp3 Wma Converter V2.0 Disc From http://www.koyotesoft.com/ - As of THIS DATE (Late 2011) THE PRO VERSION IS FREE, JUST CLICK ON PURCHASE FOR FREE SERIAL #.(Limited Time) The FREE version works just as well. Most popular audio formats can easily be converted with this most unheard of, yet very easy to use program. I thought it wise to lead off with this because of so many questions about how to convert Flac to other formats almost always pop up in the comments for Flac recordings.\n\nThis is likely the best single studio album Seger ever produced, as his greatest hits discs clearly show. \n\nRemix: I realize that any body can call music &quot;Remastered&quot; and it may sound no better. But after listening carefully to the Disc I burned of this I must say that the DRUMS sound much better, The drugs sound much tighter and even roll from the left channel to the right and so forth. It is an improvement. From now on this will likely be the only version of Night Moves I ever play.\n\nAudio Checker listed all songs at or near 100% probability of being from CDDA. I will spare you the log as it seems I have already mis-placed it.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTaken From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Moves_%28album%29\n(Below)\n\nNight Moves is the ninth studio album by American rock singer Bob Seger, and his first with the Silver Bullet Band. It was released in October 1976 (see 1976 in music). Although the front cover only credits backing by the Silver Bullet Band, 4 of the 9 songs on the album feature backing by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section.[2]\n\nThe album was well received by critics and gave Bob Seger nation-wide success. Three singles were released from the album, with two of them making the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album became Bob Segers second to become certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and was his first to be certified platinum by the same association.[6]\n\nReception\n\nPopular music critic Robert Christgau feels that the riffs on Night Moves are classic rock and roll riffs, like those performed by Chuck Berry or the Rolling Stones, and feels that the album is about rock and roll for those who are no longer in their teens, like the song \\&quot;Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\&quot;.[4] The Rolling Stone review of the album by Kit Rachlis stated that the album is one of the best to come out of 1976-77, that Seger sounds like Rod Stewart and writes lyrics like Bruce Springsteen, and that album is classic rock and roll. The only problem that Rachlis had with the album was the production not being strong enough.[Uploader\\'s Note: This Problem Is Now Fixed With This Remix][5] A later review of the album by Stephen Thomas Erlewine for Allmusic says that the album was very similar to Beautiful Loser, but Night Moves is harder than Beautiful Loser. Erlewine also feels that the album has a wide-range of styles and has not lost any of its influence years later.[3]\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Bob Seger, except where noted.

Released as a single in December 1976, it eventually reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart. In doing so, it almost singlehandedly changed Seger from being a popular regional \n\nRecording\n\nSeger and the Silver Bullet Band went to Toronto for three days to record a few tracks with The Guess Who\\'s producer Jack Richardson, whose Nimbus 9 Productions company was hot at the time. The band quickly recorded two Seger originals, one of which was \\&quot;Long Long Gone\\&quot;,[1] and a cover of the Motown hit \\&quot;My World Is Empty Without You\\&quot;, but before Seger left on the third day, he composed a fourth song to record.[2] Seger said that the song was influenced by Bruce Springsteen\\'s \\&quot;Jungleland\\&quot;.[3] As the only members of the Silver Bullet Band still in Toronto were the bassist and drummer (plus Seger on acoustic guitar and piano), Richardson recruited local session musicians to play electric guitar and organ.[2]\n\nRichardson said that \\&quot;the whole arrangement came together in the studio.\\&quot;[2] \\&quot;Night Moves\\&quot; is a mid-tempo number that starts quietly with acoustic guitar. Bass guitar and drums are introduced as the song\\'s setting is described: 1962, cornfields, \\'60 Chevy. An intense summertime teenage affair is described, knowingly more sexual than romantic, with short instrumental lines breaking the evocative imagery sometimes in mid-sentence. Piano, female backing vocals, electric guitar and organ are added as the song\\'s emotional nostalgia builds momentum. Then suddenly it stops, as the narrative flashes forward to some period in the future. To a quiet acoustic guitar, the narrator, awakened by a clap of thunder and unable to fall back asleep, ponders a different sense of the title phrase. Then the rest of the instruments fall back in, for an extended coda vamp of the chorus.\n\nAn edit of the song was generated that omitted the narrative interlude. (This abbreviated version is the one that was used on the \\&quot;FM\\&quot; soundtrack.)\n\nAfter the tracks were mixed by Richardson and engineer Brian Christian, Richardson said that he received a call from Seger\\'s manager/producer Punch Andrews expressing dissatisfaction with the tracks, and Andrews said that Capitol Records had been equally disappointed.[2] A few months later, when Richardson was talking to a Capitol A&amp;R executive, he asked about the Seger sessions and was told that \\&quot;both tracks\\&quot; were potential B-sides.[2] It turned out that Seger and Andrews had never given \\&quot;Night Moves\\&quot; to Capitol, so Richardson did[2] and, after hearing it, Capitol made it the title track of Seger\\'s next album, as well as the first single.\n\nSeger remembers the sessions somewhat differently. He claims that it was his decision to use musicians other than his normal band, and that he saw the song as potentially the one that would define his career.[3] However, that appears to be inconsistent with the fact that the song was not submitted to Capitol by Seger and Andrews.\n[edit] Critical reaction\n\nMusic writer Samuel Delliance of The New York Post wrote in 1977, \\&quot;\\'Night Moves\\' is supposed to take place in Michigan in the early 1960s, but it is timeless and placeless. You can be across the street from Kissena Park in Queens in the early evening with no one in sight and the song will suddenly flood your mind just as it did Seger\\'s.\\&quot; In his 1979 volume Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island, famed rock critic Greil Marcus selected the single \\&quot;Night Moves\\&quot; for inclusion on same, writing simply: \\&quot;The mystic chords of memory.\\&quot; [4]\n\n\\&quot;Night Moves\\&quot; was named by Rolling Stone as Best Single of the Year for 1977. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame named it one of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll,[5] Seger\\'s only such selection.\n[edit] Music video\n\nIn 1994, nearly 20 years after the original song was released, an accompanying music video was released.[6] Directed by Wayne Isham, it was set in a drive-in movie theater in the early 1960s, it interspersed footage of Seger performing in a present-day version of the drive-in (seemingly, now abandoned) with various vignettes featuring characters described in the song. Matt LeBlanc was in the starring role, prior to his debut in Friends. Also featured in the video was a pre-Melrose Place Daphne Zuniga. In the video, Daphne\\'s dark, edgy young woman becomes a visual fascination for Matt\\'s clean-cut young man.\n[edit] Cultural manifestations\n\nFilmmaker Gary Weis produced an unofficial music video for \\&quot;Night Moves\\&quot; that aired on Saturday Night Live in January 1977.\n\nSeger recorded a special version of \\&quot;Night Moves\\&quot; for the 1981 animated film American Pop.
