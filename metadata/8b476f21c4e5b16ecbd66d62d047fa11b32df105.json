He's sent a transporter where he puts the eggs - unfortunately the transporter takes him with it and then gets lost in space. After 53 deep-frozen years, he's found by a private wreckage collector team under the unscrupulous Rick. On behalf of the mighty company Terracor they bring him to an empty space station - but Rick is curious and opens the box... so Charlie has work again, to keep the Critters from eating everybody.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101628/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101628/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b476f21c4e5b16ecbd66d62d047fa11b32df105","amp;dn":"Critters+4+%281992%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b476f21c4e5b16ecbd66d62d047fa11b32df105","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,71,111,33,196,229,177,110,203,214,109,98,208,71,250,17,179,45,241,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
