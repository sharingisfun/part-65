Trent Raznor and Atticus Ross released \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Social Network\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; soundtrack in diferent formats last year, including a version in 5.1 surround sound (loseless PCM).\n\nIt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the first that I heard of a audio only disc being released in Blu-Ray, but, if you think about it it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the only way we should listen to Nine Inch Nails. The most impressive album of 2010, IMO.\n\nHere you guys can read a message from the duo: http://www.nullco.com/TSN/\n\n::::..:.....:::::::.....:::.::::::::................:::::::.....:::...::..:\n\nTrent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and producer Atticus Ross recently completed the soundtrack for David Fincher\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s upcoming docudrama The Social Network and have announced that the soundtrack will be available in an audio-only Blu-ray. Expected to ship the week of October 18th, the 19-track disc will feature the entire The Social Network soundtrack in lossless stereo and 5.1 surround sound. \n\nThose who pre-order the disc will gain immediate access to download the 5-track sampler, as well as receive the entire soundtrack in 320kbps MP3 format. This marks the second time Reznor has released his material in the Blu-ray Audio format, the first being the Ghosts I-IV. \n\nTrack List:\n\nHand Covers Bruise\nIn Motion\nA Familiar Taste\nIt Catches Up With You\nIntriguing Possibilities\nPainted Sun In Abstract\n3:14 Every Night\nPieces Form the Whole\nCarbon Prevails\nEventually We Find Our Way\nPenetration\nIn The Hall of the Mountain King\nOn We March\nMagnetic\nAlmost Home\nHand Covers Bruise, Reprise\nComplication with Optimistic Outcome\nThe Gentle Hum of Anxiety\nSoft Trees Break the Fall","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf7c3ca59299ad66a64274be614a32d3d42e5567","amp;dn":"Trent+Raznor+and+Atticus+Ros+-+The+Social+Network+Soundtrack+HD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf7c3ca59299ad66a64274be614a32d3d42e5567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,124,60,165,146,153,173,102,166,66,116,190,97,74,50,211,212,46,85,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
