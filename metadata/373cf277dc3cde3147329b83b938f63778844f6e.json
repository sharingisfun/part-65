Created by XYZZY-award winning author Robb Sherwin, it merges interactive fiction-style puzzles and narrative with cryptid creation and fighting. It features over 60 cryptids to make, 200 characters to encounter and a soundtrack of over 70 songs. A character-driven piece that is a blend of sci-fi and comedy, it is one of the best advances in graphical interactive fiction in years, and a fine successor to the Infocom and Magnetic Scrolls tradition. \n\nThe free interpreter &quot;Hugor&quot; is required for play on OS X and Linux.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373cf277dc3cde3147329b83b938f63778844f6e","amp;dn":"Cryptozookeeper+2011+PC+Mac+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373cf277dc3cde3147329b83b938f63778844f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,60,242,119,220,60,222,49,71,50,155,131,185,56,246,55,120,132,79,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
