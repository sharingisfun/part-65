Fans will also enjoy HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dramatic interpretations of\nCreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; and HowlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ WolfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Killing Floor&quot;\n[with the Experience joined by Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady] as well his\nrendition of Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; which has been selected as the\nlead track for this special release.\n\nThis special deluxe box set features never before released music from each of the\nsix unforgettable Winterland performances. The new standard and deluxe editions\nof Winterland are markedly different from a single disc compilation, long out of print,\nthat was briefly issued by Rykodisc in 1987 and 1988.\n\nThe deluxe edition also presents a rare interview with Hendrix recorded backstage at\nthe Boston Garden a few weeks after the Winterland performances.\nThis previously unreleased bonus provides fans with a unique window into HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nviews about his background, his approach to the guitar and songwriting and future\ndirection of his music.\n\nThe deluxe edition also features a 36 page booked filled with previously unpublished\nimages by acclaimed photographers Robert Knight, Allen Tannenbaum and Jim Marshall\nas well as an essay by noted Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n10/10/68 Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco\n\n01.
