Over a million visitors flock each year to enjoy the glories of this beautiful garden, which hold a special place in our horticultural history. However, Kew is so much more than just a garden it is also a highly respected centre of pioneering science, research and conservation. This twelve part BBC television series is a month-by-month journey through the garden, following the work of a committed team of experts offering a unique insight into the gardens, glasshouses, laboratories and museums that give Kew its reputation for excellence. In each episode we are introduced to some of the Gardens' spectacular monthly highlights, including the unrivalled orchid festival in February, the famous crocus carpet in March and the stunning autumn colour of the sweet chestnut, Kew's oldest tree. Throughout we follow the team of experts as we see how their enthusiasm and skills help maintain Kew's role as world leader in plant research, conservation, horticultural practice and as the world's most beautiful botanic garden.\n\n\n1)  Pests in the Palm House \nThe tree gang, headed by Jon Hammerton, deal with a diseased tree, while in the Palm house, keeper Emma Fox is on the attack against a plague of thrips. Outside, preparations for a giant badger sett are also underway.\n\n2)  Titan Arum Opens \nDisplays co-ordinator Phil Griffiths prepares the mighty titan arum for its moment of glory, watched eagerly by Kew's expert in foul smells, Dr Geoffrey Kite. Elsewhere the team put the final touches to the Go Wild festival and the tree gang deal with a giant bamboo emergency in the Palm House.\n\n3)  Summer Planting \nIt's all hands on deck as the biggest planting of the year gets underway. Sarah Smith and her team have just four days to transform the Palm House border. The tree gang help out with a project at a local school and the Orangery hosts its annual charity auction.\n\n4)  The Plant Auction \nThe world's leading expert of Madagascan palms, John Dransfield is on the hunt for an exotic palm that's facing extinction, while Steve Ketley, Keeper of the fern collection has some giant moth coccoons to find a home for. Elsewhere Emma Fox is coaxing the giant waterlily into growth.\n\n5)  Summer Swing Concerts \nIt's a nail-biting time as Head of Horticulture Nigel Taylor waits for news about UNESCO World Heritage status for the gardens and Emma Fox taks on the role of a nocturnal beetle to pollinate the giant water lilies. Beneath the Palm House Pete Morris dons his waders to restock the marine display.\n\n6)  The Drought \nArboretum manager Ray Townsend and his team are hard at work irrigating the gardens during the hottest summer for years, while arboretum head Tony Kirkham travels to Italy to search for matching pairs of mature trees for the Pagoda vista.\n\n7)  Cyad Cones \nThe tree team are called to the Palm House to tackle a tree that is giving cause for concern. Ray Townsend travels to Japan to collect specimens and Tony Kirkham uses the old-fashioned methods of harvesting wheat, and with a bit of help, makes his own loaf of bread.\n\n8)  Japanese Surprise \nA small Japanese island is the destination for Ray Townsend as he attempts to bring back a record breaking number of seeds. Phil Griffiths has a lucky day when he discover a large tree trunk that is perfect for one of his displays in the Princess of Wales Greenhouse.\n\n9)  The Autumn Festival \nRay Townsend meets a fellow bamboo expert while asking for directions in Japan, while back at the gardens Phil Griffiths creates a stunning display of pumpkins and gourds. In one of the galleries a scholarship student is displaying her botanical artwork\n\n10)  Seed Collecting in Madagascar \nThe curator of the Millennium Seed Bank, Stuart Cable, travels to Madagascar to collect seeds from endangered species and Sarah Smith and Emma Gardner delve into the past when an archaeological dig begins at Kew Palace. Randall Keynes the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin pays a visit to the gardens in search of a rare rhododendron.\n\n11)  Problems with the Cold \nA fault is detected in the heating system for the Palm and Waterlilly houses, putting the exotic specimens in the Waterlily house at risk. Tony Kirkham plants the new trees that have arrived from Italy and Stuart Cable continues his seed collecting trip in Madagascar.\n\n12)  The Orchid Festival \nAs the seasons turn full circle, the tree gang gears up for the spring. Tony Hall gives the new students advice on replanting islands in the lake and there is great excitement as the world's oldest pot plant is about to produce a cone.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4374/ayearatkewscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4374/ayearatkewscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/3753/ayearatkewscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/3753/ayearatkewscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/7481/ayearatkewscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/7481/ayearatkewscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img508.imageshack.us/img508/4570/ayearatkewscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img508.imageshack.us/img508/4570/ayearatkewscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/111/ayearatkewscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/111/ayearatkewscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img683.imageshack.us/img683/4247/ayearatkewscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img683.imageshack.us/img683/4247/ayearatkewscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8633/ayearatkewscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8633/ayearatkewscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/2764/ayearatkewscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/2764/ayearatkewscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9465/ayearatkewscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9465/ayearatkewscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1586 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2ch\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime per Part 29.mins\n * Number of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 350 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kew.org/about-kew/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kew.org/about-kew/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Kew%3A%20The%20Garden%20that%20Changed%20the%20World&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Kew%3A%20The%20Garden%20that%20Changed%20the%20World&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=What%20the%20Victorians%20did%20for%20Us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=What%20the%20Victorians%20did%20for%20Us&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Garden%20Secrets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Garden%20Secrets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Britain%27s%20Park%20Story&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Britain%27s%20Park%20Story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Genius%20of%20Britain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Genius%20of%20Britain&lt;/a&gt;\n\n3)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=A_Year_at_Kew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=A_Year_at_Kew&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fc4ddb4f241671d84400ae81d024b7a7e4e9ab2","amp;dn":"BBC+A+Year+at+Kew+09of12+The+Autumn+Festival+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fc4ddb4f241671d84400ae81d024b7a7e4e9ab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,196,221,180,242,65,103,29,132,64,10,232,29,2,75,122,126,78,154,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
