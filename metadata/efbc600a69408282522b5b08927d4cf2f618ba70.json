The game was originally released in 2001 and has since had a lot of success. The game has always been ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Pay-to-playÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which is why private Ragnarok Online servers became so popular. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m surprised it took Gravity so long to launch a free version of their game, but in October 2008 gravity launched a single free-to-play server on iRO (International Ragnarok Online) called Valkyrie which would pay for itself by selling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cash shop itemsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.  The free server ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ValkyrieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is largely the same as the pay to play servers, but with slightly slower experience gain. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not familiar with the game, Ragnarok Online is a 3D Fantasy MMORPG with detailed 2D sprites and beautifully animated visuals. It has a large selection of playable classes and a huge game world to explore. The game may be a bit older than other MMORPGs, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still been able to keep fresh with regular content updates from the publisher. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never played Ragnarok Online before give the game a try!\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Pros\n+Plenty of job advancements.\n+Great music and visuals.\n+Large game world.\n+Huge community.\n+Varied PvP options.\n+Regular content updates.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Cons \n-Poor questing system.\n-Minimal character customization.\n-Grind based leveling.\n-PvP imbalances.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Torrent Details\nThis torrent contains all the kRO and Renewal Files necessary to play on private and/or International Ragnarok Servers.Just Install the game client with the self-installer given in the torrent.For further Details please refer to the &quot;readme.txt&quot;given in the torrent.if you have any questions post them in the comments section Thx.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efbc600a69408282522b5b08927d4cf2f618ba70","amp;dn":"Ragnarok+Online+Full+Client%5BkRO+%2B+RagRE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efbc600a69408282522b5b08927d4cf2f618ba70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,188,96,10,105,64,130,130,82,43,91,8,146,125,76,242,246,24,186,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
