Denis is seen as being her rock as she first enters parliament and then runs for the leadership of the Conservative Party, culminating in her eventual premiereship. Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margret's life forever.\n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b432bf412836fd842826455689db22b0a548315","amp;dn":"The+Iron+Lady+%28+Nordic+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b432bf412836fd842826455689db22b0a548315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,67,43,244,18,131,111,216,66,130,100,85,104,157,178,43,10,84,131,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
