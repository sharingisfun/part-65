It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1818fa2c4c6ebcdd72250a26ae8a06e69c677b4","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+12+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1818fa2c4c6ebcdd72250a26ae8a06e69c677b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,129,143,162,196,198,235,205,215,34,80,162,106,232,160,110,105,198,119,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
