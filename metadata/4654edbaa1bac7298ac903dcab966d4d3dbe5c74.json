In the bedlam of lawlessness and starvation, hungry, desperate men arrive from the nearest town to take their meager supplies. A benevolent stranger keeps coming in the night to steal food. Sensing the stranger means no harm, Nate leaves food out as charity. But the stranger ignores offers to join them, then comes to their aid when a gang of prison escapees, led by an old nemesis of Nate's, raids their home. In the end, it is the kindness of a father desperate to save his son that may give two families and the stranger an opportunity to build a new life in a post-apocalypse world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4654edbaa1bac7298ac903dcab966d4d3dbe5c74","amp;dn":"APOCALYPSE+LAW+-+John+Grit+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4654edbaa1bac7298ac903dcab966d4d3dbe5c74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,84,237,186,161,186,199,41,138,201,3,220,171,150,109,77,61,190,92,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
