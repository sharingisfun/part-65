I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement \n of the contents.\n\n Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: \n Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing \n until you've researched it yourself.\n \n !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !! \n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n..........\n\nfolder.jpg courtesy of commenter &quot;Nighted&quot; at the sebaygo1 blog\n..........\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c399ec7536be27ae5943684472332483a16fe747","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2011+July+20+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c399ec7536be27ae5943684472332483a16fe747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,153,236,117,54,190,39,174,89,67,104,68,114,51,36,131,161,111,231,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
