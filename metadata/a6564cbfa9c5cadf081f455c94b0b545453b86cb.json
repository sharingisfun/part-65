The flashbacks which make up the body of the film are printed in sepia and shot in a style reminiscent of Flaherty and Sjostrom. It's a nostalgic, memorable piece from the veteran Bob Quinn, not so much for the resigned mood of the storyteller, as for the deeply moving imagery - a collie running up a hill; the white-clothed ankle of a girl; the dancing torches of a midnight search party; the expressive, weather-beaten faces of the villagers. The dialogue is in Gaelic, post-synched and quiet, as if heard from down the tunnel of memory.\n\nInfo:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112512/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6564cbfa9c5cadf081f455c94b0b545453b86cb","amp;dn":"The+Bishop%27s+Story+-+1994+-+Bob+Quinn+-+DVDRip+-+BENTLEY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6564cbfa9c5cadf081f455c94b0b545453b86cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,86,76,191,169,197,202,223,8,31,69,92,148,176,181,69,69,59,134,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
