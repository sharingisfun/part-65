Now, as Blood Orange, not only does he have a smoother way with vocal lines, he backpedals from Bright Eyes emo and settles into a weird, poppy blend of chillwave, RnB, and 80s new wave. The new persona and synthesized backbeats seem to better coincide with his personality, and Coastal Grooves is the first outing where Hynes sounds completely at home with being unusual. The accompanying black-and-white stills in the albums artwork tell of the forlorn stripper story that he is trying to convey, and he captures the mood perfectly, in an album that is fashionably slick, altogether tragic, and deceptively beautiful.\n\nReleased: Aug 8, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Electronic\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n \n 1.
