Stevens investigates this sighting and finds the snake. Because the snake is not used to such a hostile environment, he bags it to be relocated to a more suitable habitat. Past encounters of snakes from past episodes are also discussed.\n\nThis episode is not in the HD quality that all of my other Austin Stevens uploads are - but it does the job. I have been looking for this episode for a long time, and I'm happy to be able to share it with everyone. Truly a great episode, with recaps from previous episodes also.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3bfb755a6808da5cb8a5a792a89ad7329e36e97","amp;dn":"Austin+Stevens+-+Snakemaster+-+14+-+In+Search+of+the+Black+Mamba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3bfb755a6808da5cb8a5a792a89ad7329e36e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,191,183,85,166,128,141,165,203,138,90,121,42,137,173,115,41,227,110,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
