The children remain in the coma for the next 10 years and \n\nall children born during this time are born into the same state. Ten \n\nyears later Tom Russel, who was imprisoned after killing a man in a \n\nfight, is released from prison and returns to his home town where \n\nhis older brother has a son in a coma. That night all the children \n\nwake up but they are hellbent on killing all the adults. It soon \n\nbecomes apparent that the children share a sort of collective \n\nconsciousness and as one learns they all learn. As they get smarter \n\nthey learn to disable motor vehicles and eventually to use firearms. \n\nA group of survivors, led by Tom and Jean, try to escape to the \n\nsafety of a base located 60 km outside the town.\n\nDirector: Hal Masonberg\nWriters: Hal Masonberg, Teal Minton\nStars: James Van Der Beek, Ivana Milicevic and Brad Hunt | See full \n\ncast and crew \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd1136c1c93184fc02fe40cb1e328d93713605a","amp;dn":"The+Plague+%282006%29+DVDRip+%28Hindi+-+English%29+Nirmalbaba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd1136c1c93184fc02fe40cb1e328d93713605a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,209,19,108,28,147,24,79,192,47,228,12,177,227,40,217,55,19,96,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
