When a chance encounter with an on-ice thug leads to a bloody fist fight that Doug easily wins, the coach of the Halifax Highlanders sees potential in this mammoth sized man who is only hampered by his lack of any hockey playing ability and his brother's old figure skates. Standing up to the taunts of the other players, Doug manages to join the team, and with the encouragement of his hockey obsessed best friend quickly becomes a rising star. Soon he'll have the opportunity to face off against Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Rhea and perhaps finally land a girlfriend. Now - all he needs is to learn how to skate.\n \nCast:\n Seann William Scott ... Doug Glatt\n Jay Baruchel ... Ryan\n Alison Pill ... Eva\n Liev Schreiber ... Ross Rhea\n Eugene Levy ...
