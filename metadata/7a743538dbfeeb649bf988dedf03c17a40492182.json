Maybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m older than the dirt IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m standinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on, but why is it every Match 3 puzzle game makes ya get 3-in-a-row? Not just 3 touching ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3 in a row. If ya had 3 chickens with one in front, one to the side, and one behind, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still 3 chickens, right? ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a match, inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t?\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/Win7\nCPU: 1.2 GHz\nRAM: 512 MB\nDirectX: 9.0\nHard Drive: 42 MB\n\n[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6152492812_4723c70b30.jpg[/img]\n\nWork like you don't need money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one's watching\n- Unknown Author -\n\nAnd Seed like there is no bandwith limit :)\n\nSupport Us\nYour &quot;Thank You&quot; means a lot\n\n[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5841348205_e896fe6f30.jpg[/img]\n\nThanks to LeeGT\n\nAnd Let's never forget the work of Flight of the Conchords","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a743538dbfeeb649bf988dedf03c17a40492182","amp;dn":"Homesteader++-+NEW++Match+3+Game+%5BAllSmartGames%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a743538dbfeeb649bf988dedf03c17a40492182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,116,53,56,219,254,235,100,155,249,136,222,223,3,193,122,64,73,33,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
