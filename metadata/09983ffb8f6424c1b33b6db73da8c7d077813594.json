As a pioneer of the American thrash metal movement, Megadeth rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the &quot;Big Four of Thrash&quot; along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing the thrash metal sub-genre.\n\nMegadeth has experienced numerous line-up changes, due partly to the band's notorious substance abuse problems.

Megadeth, along with their new lead guitarist Chris Broderick, released their twelfth studio album, titled Endgame, on September 15, 2009, which debuted at #9 on the Billboard 200, marking Megadeth's fifth top 10 album.\n\nIn the band's 26 active years, there have been over 20 individuals that have all officially been a part of the group at different times, with Dave Mustaine and David Ellefson being the only original members still in the line-up, with Ellefson leaving temporarily. Megadeth is known for its distinctive, technical instrumental style, often featuring dense, intricate passages. and trade-off guitar solos, as well as for Mustaine's recurring lyrical themes including politics, war, addiction, personal relationships, and religious themes.
