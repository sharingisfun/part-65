A prologue shows infants classified 1A and placed in an academy promoting violent militarism. Spawned in such an environment, Sgt. Todd (Kurt Russell) became a top-ranking interplanetary fighter. However, military upgrades in genetic engineering made Todd obsolete. Todd\\'s commanding officer, Captain Church (Gary Busey), has a confrontation with West Point-trained Colonel Mekum (Jason Isaacs), who heads the new generation of genetically engineered fighters. One such warrior is Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee), who defeats Todd and others led by Church. The trio, presumed dead, is put in a garbage ship which dumps them on the distant Arcadia 234 planet. However, Todd survives and is nursed by homesteaders Sandra (Connie Nielsen) and Mace (Sean Pertwee), while their mute son Nathan (brothers Jared and Taylor Thorne) watches. Todd is regarded with suspicion by others in the colony. But when the warrior supermen, led by Caine 607, attack the settlement, Todd turns out to be their only line of defense. The one-man army springs into action to eliminate the super squadron amid leftover props from Demolition Man, Event Horizon and other sci-fi movies.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 39 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 672\n\nFrame Height: 384\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 118kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c41f22fc6f663a9bae9998e7a7eef9237f71fe","amp;dn":"Soldier%281998%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c41f22fc6f663a9bae9998e7a7eef9237f71fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,196,31,34,252,111,102,58,155,174,153,152,231,167,238,249,35,127,113,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
