This set is circa 2004.\n\nThe file is quite large, so allow a LONG time for it to download.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbvdocs.org/Accenture/ESM_2.0_8-23-04.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbvdocs.org/Accenture/ESM_2.0_8-23-04.zip&lt;/a&gt;\n323,592 KB\n\nAlso perhaps of interest is this set of notes:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbvdocs.org/Accenture/Accenture_Wrap_up.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbvdocs.org/Accenture/Accenture_Wrap_up.zip&lt;/a&gt;\n2305 KB\n\nNote that one of the service items reveals that it was tripling votes for &quot;random&quot; voters in the 2004 primary. Files I have obtained show that it doubled or tripled votes in the 2008 primary, and also in the May 2010 and Aug 2010 primaries in Tennessee. However: It is not random. It only appears to be random when voters are sorted by fields other than precinct/voter ID. In fact, it is doubling and tripling recorded votes in white Republican suburbs.\n\nNow you can examine some of the logic (or lack of) in the programs yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44fb4c9281e3b08b1869b2855048b8798b41ebab","amp;dn":"Accenture+software+for+voter+registration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44fb4c9281e3b08b1869b2855048b8798b41ebab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,251,76,146,129,227,176,139,24,105,178,133,80,72,184,121,139,65,235,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
