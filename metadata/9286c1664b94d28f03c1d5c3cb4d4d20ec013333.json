Among them are Ghost, who sees what others do not. Ann, longing for love, and Jason, whose real name is Nothing, newly awakened to an ancient, deathless truth about his father, and himself. \n\nOthers are coming to Missing Mile tonight. Three beautiful, hip vagabonds - Molochai, Twig, and the seductive Zillah, whose eyes are as green as limes are on their own lost journey, slaking their ancient thirst for blood, looking for supple young flesh. \n\nThey find it in Nothing and Ann, leading them on a mad, illicit road trip south to New Orleans. Over miles of dark highway, Ghost pursues, his powers guiding him on a journey to reach his destiny, to save Ann from her new companions, to save Ann from her new companions, to save Nothing from himself...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9286c1664b94d28f03c1d5c3cb4d4d20ec013333","amp;dn":"Poppy+Z.+Brite+-+Lost+Souls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9286c1664b94d28f03c1d5c3cb4d4d20ec013333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,134,193,102,75,148,210,143,3,193,213,195,203,77,77,32,236,1,51,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
