The name matches the paint design with its hot rod style flame job, the show with its snarling, flashy manoeuvres and Skip's forethought in his crowd pleasing routine.\n\nPrometheus the flying machine is part Pitts Special and the rest Skip and Christina Stewart. Starting life as a Pitts S-2S, Prometheus was modified to give Skip the airshow machine he wanted. This flying machine looks like a good old American hot rod. The horsepower was increased to 400HP, the big three bladed prop reminds you of oversized racing slicks, the rear canted landing gear makes it look fast sitting on the ground and the paint job yells 'Street Rod.'&quot;\n\nDesigned and developed by Owen Hewitt in collaboration with Skip Stewart Airshows, this rendition of Prometheus is a true treat to fly for all aerobatic fans!\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Custom soundpack by IRIS AudioworX.\n    Superb aerobatic flight model allowing truly outrageous manoeuvres!\n    Skip's 2011 paint scheme in glorious 4096x4096 pixel resolution.\n      Fantastic 3D gauges for silky smooth performance.\n       \n\n\n         \n      ***************************Alef1995***************************\n\n\n\nREQ VRS SUPERBUG W O R K I N G PLEASE (: ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a1895c31ffd26b09b26ca5b9954fcd2f771a1f","amp;dn":"IRIS+-+AIRSHOW+SERIES+-+PROMETHEUS+FOR+FSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a1895c31ffd26b09b26ca5b9954fcd2f771a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,161,137,92,49,255,210,107,9,178,108,165,185,149,79,205,47,119,26,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
