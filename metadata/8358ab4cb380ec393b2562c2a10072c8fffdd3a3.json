Actor Hume Cronyn turns in a           \n brilliantly understated performance as widower John     \n Webb, an elderly Texas farmer who is trying to cope     \n with the loss of his wife and what seems to be a sudden \n lack of purpose in his life. When an oil company        \n expresses an interest in drilling on his land, Webb's   \n relatives suddenly see a chance for fast cash, and his  \n placid demeanor is sorely tested. While Cronyn takes    \n center stage, this production from the Showtime network \n also benefits from a wonderful cast that includes James \n Earl Jones, Shelley Duvall, Ed Begley Jr., and Frederic \n Forrest. The Texas setting is beautifully depicted,     \n with Foote's screenplay providing poignant local        \n touches to illuminate the lives of the characters.      \n While the pace is not terribly fast, a momentum does    \n develop, and the motivations of everyone--including     \n greedy nephews, irresponsible daughters, obnoxious      \n children, and, thankfully, some kindly old              \n friends--slowly emerge. This is a story both gentle and \n gripping. Cronyn gives his character a quiet dignity,   \n and his masterful performance and the unavoidable       \n family conflicts give the film a remarkable resonance.  \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n               Hume Cronyn ...
