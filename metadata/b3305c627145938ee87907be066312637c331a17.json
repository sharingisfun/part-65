This is not related to real-life speed as we often write plenty of small files to external drives.\n\nOur investigations show that some flash drives perform worse than others when writing small files, but perform equally well when writing large files.\n\nZentimo measures the file read\\write speeds of 3 different file sizes: small files (32 KB), medium files (3 MB) and large files (100 MB) and displays all those measurements as well as an average. The average speed calculated by Zentimo reflects your drives real performance more accurately than characteristics from the vendor's specification. \n\nWhat's the difference from USB Safely Remove?\n==============================================\nUSB Safely Remove is our another similiar program which is less powerful than Zentimo but has simpler UI.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3305c627145938ee87907be066312637c331a17","amp;dn":"Zentimo+xStorage+Manager+v1.4.1.1186+%2B+Crack+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3305c627145938ee87907be066312637c331a17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,48,92,98,113,69,147,142,232,121,7,190,6,99,18,99,124,51,26,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
