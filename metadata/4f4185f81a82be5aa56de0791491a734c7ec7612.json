The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the premiere audience in 1939, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reconstructed until 1959. That version, which has stunned viewers for decades, is presented here.\n\n*** \nI upload my torrents to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid, if you would like to upload one of my torrent files to another tracker feel free. \nAll I ask is that you upload the same torrent file you downloaded by clicking on one of my links so that more seeders/peers are in the swarm.  \n***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f4185f81a82be5aa56de0791491a734c7ec7612","amp;dn":"Rules+of+the+Game+%281939%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29+Criterion+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f4185f81a82be5aa56de0791491a734c7ec7612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,65,133,248,26,130,190,90,165,109,224,121,20,145,167,52,199,236,118,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
