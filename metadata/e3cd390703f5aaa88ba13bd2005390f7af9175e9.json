It's a little like Hitchcock's &quot;Rope,&quot; but it's on location! Carl, an ex-con who sets out to rob the prison laundry system where he worked for 5 years (while in the pen), has spent ten years in prison planning the ultimate heist. Upon his release, he meets up with a high school buddy, who's made all the arrangements for the job, and rented him a hooker for his first encounter in a decade with a real girl. After picking up the safecracker and their getaway driver, they've got twenty minutes to pull off the perfect heist...but soon everything falls apart before Carl's eyes. He might still get the girl, though!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120042/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120042/&lt;/a&gt;\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3cd390703f5aaa88ba13bd2005390f7af9175e9","amp;dn":"Running+Time+%5B1997%5D+German%2C+English+DVD+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3cd390703f5aaa88ba13bd2005390f7af9175e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,205,57,7,3,245,170,168,139,161,59,210,0,83,144,247,175,145,117,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
