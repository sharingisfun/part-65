I do want to credit pinkfloydeffect and thecult.  I dont\nknow if they converted the episodes, but they did upload them.\n\n\nThis set will complete you Bob Ross video collection.\n\nHere is what is included:\n\n1Hr - Beginners Workshop\n3Hr - Instructional  Workshop\nBR01 - Peace Offerings of Summer\nBR02 - Winter Glory\nBR03 - Grandeur of Summer\nBR04 - Autumn Stream\nBR05 - Winter Harmony\nBR06 - Winter Nocturne\nBR07 - Seascape with Lighthouse\nBR08 - Times Past\nBR09 - Summer Reflections\n\nThe 1 hour Beginners Workshop talks about the tools needed for wet on wet painting as well as the basics on using those\ntools.  At the end he shows a painting project that HAS been seen on the TV show.\n\nThe 3 hour instructional workshop goes into more detail on hour to use the tools, create effects and correct errors.  At the \nend he completes a painting project, I believe that this is a new painting never seen on TV, but i am not sure.\n\nThe other 9 programs are 1 hour instructional videos, so Bob Ross goes into more detail than in the TV show.  They each are a \nnew painting that has never been seen on the TV show.\n\nNote:  Any errors that you see in the videos were on the DVD.  It seems that these were transferred from VHS to DVD, so they do\nhave a couple of issues, but they dont take away from the program.\n\nI hope that you enjoy these videos.  Please leave a comment telling me what you favorite one is, mine is #6.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3edf271643e2ede979667b3496022b86f30829b0","amp;dn":"The+Joy+of+Painting+-+Instructional+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3edf271643e2ede979667b3496022b86f30829b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,223,39,22,67,226,237,233,121,102,123,52,150,2,43,134,243,8,41,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
