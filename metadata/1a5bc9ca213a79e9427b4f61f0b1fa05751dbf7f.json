To find out, adventure filmmaker Alun Hughes joins high altitude paragliding star John Silvester on a tandem paraglider and goes 'col busting' in the Karakoram.\n\nLeaving the comforts of Snowdonia, UK, Alun embarks on a journey into the frozen world of extreme altitude paragliding. Installing themselves in Karimabad in the now fabled Hunza valley of the Karakoram Highway, Alun straps himself to the front of SilvesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tandem paraglider and together they commit themselves deep into previously unflown terrain. The footage they bring back from their adventure is nothing short of astonishing.\n\nThis gripping adventure film documents not only an extraordinary pilot and the cutting edge of high altitude Himalayan paragliding, it also introduces a growing subculture of paragliding that has never been explored before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5bc9ca213a79e9427b4f61f0b1fa05751dbf7f","amp;dn":"BIRDMAN_OF_THE_KARAKORAM.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5bc9ca213a79e9427b4f61f0b1fa05751dbf7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,91,201,202,33,58,121,233,66,123,79,97,240,177,250,5,117,29,191,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
