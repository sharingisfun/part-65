But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fca95b4a812099b67fde80a4dfaa6cdeb15b3bbb","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+11+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fca95b4a812099b67fde80a4dfaa6cdeb15b3bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,169,91,74,129,32,153,182,127,222,128,164,223,170,108,222,177,91,59,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
