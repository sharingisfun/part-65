Since then,\n  it  has  become  a  secret  weapon of  major  artists and   producers such as Steve \n  Stevens, Vernon Reid, Devildriver, and Ill Nino.\n\n  In 2011, with Recabinet 3, it is a full-fledged, self-contained solution ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an audio\n  FX plugin for VST, AU, and    RTAS formats for  Mac OS X  and Windows. It offers 20 \n  virtual  cabinets,  8  virtual mics, and  2  internal  channels  with the  British-\n  inspired Kazrog Konsole EQ,  specifically voiced  for making guitar and bass tracks \n  come  alive.  Best  of  all,  you  can  blend  any cabinet and  microphone/position \n  combination with 100% phase coherency ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ breaking   the laws of physics!\n\n  Recabinet 3 makes  it  fast and easy  to find  inspiring  new sounds,  avoiding the \n  hassle  of complex mixer  routing   and  folder  navigation associated with impulse \n  response libraries.  It also  ships with ready-to-rock  factory  presets, with more \n  on the way from major artists and producers.\n\n  Add Recabinet 3 in the signal  chain after your favorite analog guitar amp, or your \n  favorite software amp     simulator (with cabinet simulation disabled) and you will\n  experience  a   dramatic  improvement  in  the  realism  of   your  guitar  tracks. \n  Recabinet 3  changes  the  proverbial  game, giving you  album-quality  guitar tone \n  direct, faster and easier than ever before.\n\n\n  FEATURES\n\n  Cabinets:\n\n  1960 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Marshall 1960AV 4x12\n  Angora ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Line 6 Vetta 4x12\n  Blackface 4x10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Fender ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢65 Super Reverb 4x10\n  Chordal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Roland JC120\n  Damien ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Marshall 1936 2x12\n  Dazed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Supro Thunderbolt\n  Eagle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on an ENGL Pro 4x12\n  Excel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Randall RS412XLT100 4x12\n  Genzie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Genz Benz G-Flex ported 2x12\n  Green ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on an original 1970s Marshall 4x12\n  Igor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Krank Krankenstein 4x12\n  Manatee ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on an Ampeg SVT 8x10\n  Motown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on an Ampeg Portaflex B15N\n  Ogre ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Bogner Uberkab 4x12\n  Oversize ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Mesa Standard 4x12\n  Sterling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Marshall Hand Wired 4x12 (late 1960s reissue)\n  Tangerine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on an Orange 4x12\n  Top Boost ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Vox AC30\n  Tweed 1x12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Fender ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢53 Deluxe 1x12\n  Zodiac 2x12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Selmer Zodiac Twin 30\n\n  Microphones:\n\n  57 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Shure SM57\n  545 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Shure Unidyne III 545\n  121 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Royer 121\n  409 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Sennheiser MD409\n  421 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Sennheiser MD421\n  i5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on an Audix i5\n  Reference ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on an Earthworks M30\n  U87 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ based on a Neumann U87\n\n\n  Changes in v3.0.4\n  -----------------\n\n  The update adds per-band EQ bypass,  GUI enhancements,  and bug fixes for Pro Tools\n  and Cubase. \n  \n  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ EQ Bypass  on  each  band of EQ is available.
