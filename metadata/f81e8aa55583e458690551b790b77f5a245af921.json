When I finally got it, I decided to upload it to TPB so everyone else can use it too.\n\nThis is a modified version of the popular game Minecraft that makes griefing a lot easier.  Griefing is basically razing your enemy's buildings and towns.  However, it can be pretty difficult when you're bound to the normal rules of Minecaftia.  In this torrent, I have included both the modified Minecraft client, as well as a batch file that automates it's installation in Windows (sorry Mac and Linux users, but you'll have to follow the instructions manually). \n\nHere's a few of the abilities this client gives you:\n- X-ray vision that lets you see through everything but ores.\n- Not Pushable mode which prevents other users from pushing you.\n- Click Nuker allows you to take out a good sized area with every click.\n- FullBright which removes all darkness for you.\n- Moon Jump abilities  reduces gravity's effect on you.\n- NoFall makes you immune to damage inflicted from falling a large distance.\n- And many, many more.\n\nI included this in the README as well.  Anyways, here's how to install Nodus Griefing Client:\n\nWindows:\nRun &quot;install.bat&quot;\nIf that does not work you can do it manually:\n\nGo to the location NodusUpdate.jar was saved\nCopy/cut NodusUpdate.jar\nOpen the start menu\nType in &quot;%appdata%&quot; (Type in &quot;Run&quot; for XP, and then type %appdata% in Run) and hit enter\nOpen the folder &quot;.minecraft&quot;\nOpen &quot;bin&quot;\nPaste NodusUpdate.jar into bin\nDelete &quot;minecraft.jar&quot;\nRename NodusUpdate.jar to &quot;minecraft.jar&quot;\n\n\nOSX Lion (Mac):\nGo to the location NodusUpdate.jar was saved\nCopy/cut NodusUpdate.jar\nGo to &quot;Go&quot;\nClick on &quot;Go to Folder...&quot;\nGo to the folder &quot;~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft&quot;\nOpen &quot;bin&quot;\nPaste NodusUpdate.jar into bin\nDelete &quot;minecraft.jar&quot;\nRename NodusUpdate.jar to &quot;minecraft.jar&quot;\n\n\nLinux:\nOpen Terminal.\nType &quot;cp [path]/NodusUpdate.jar .minecraft/bin&quot; but replace &quot;[path]&quot; with the actual path where the file is located (e.g. &quot;cp Downloads/Nodus_Client/NodusUpdate.jar .minecraft/bin&quot;)\nType &quot;cd .minecraft/bin&quot;\nType &quot;rm minecraft.jar&quot;\nType &quot;mv NodusUpdate.jar minecraft.jar&quot;\nFinally type &quot;exit&quot;\nDon't actually type in the quotes, they are just so you are aware of where the command starts and where it ends.\n\n\nI hope everyone has had as much with this as I have!\nIf you have any questions, feel free to PM me.\nSpecial thanks to Stonecold1995 for making the quick installation program for Windows (yeah, I know it's simple but I can't into even batch files) and of course, Nodus for making the client itself.\n\nOriginal site for the client: http://nodusgriefing.com/index.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81e8aa55583e458690551b790b77f5a245af921","amp;dn":"Nodus+Minecraft+Griefing+Client","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81e8aa55583e458690551b790b77f5a245af921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,30,138,165,85,131,228,88,105,5,81,183,144,183,127,90,36,90,249,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
