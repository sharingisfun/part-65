To some he is the sports entertainment innovator and visionary corporate leader of a multimillion dollar company. To others he is evil personified- the manipulative sadistic boss of a corral of WWE Superstars who takes great personal pleasure in making others suffer. Mr. McMahon has achieved stunning successes and experienced humiliating defeats and yet keeps coming back for more. What other boss requires his employees to literally kiss his bare ass on national television? This 2 disc production takes a look back at what caused Vince McMahon to come out of the announcer booth and right into some of the most controversial moments ever seen on television. For the first time ever the onscreen and offscreen intrigues of the world's most notorious boss are broken down by the people who know the man best. Exclusive interviews with Shane, Stephanie and Linda McMahon, Triple H, Hulk Hogan, Kurt Angle, Eric Bischoff, Paul Heyman, and more. Mr. McMahon himself reveals when the seed was planted to screw Bret Hart in Montreal, what it was like to win the WWE Championship, the true story behind the battle against WCW, the XFL, his daughter Stephanie marrying and more. Plus you'll see the Austin/ McMahon rivalry, the infamous Kiss My Ass Club, and his classic matches versus Stone Cold, Shane McMahon, Triple H, Hulk Hogan, the Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels.
