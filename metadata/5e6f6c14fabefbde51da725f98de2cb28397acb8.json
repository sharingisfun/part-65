(&quot;Nerve,&quot; the B-side of &quot;Hand on My Heart,&quot; is also tossed in for added value.) \nOut of the vast number of Shriekback compilations, Priests and Kanibals is obviously one of the least serviceable packages since it's little more than an audio equivalent of a baseball card blister pack, selecting highlights and completist fodder spread between two records and the singles that supported them. \nDespite the tracks being rather well chosen, there's hardly enough here to attract a diehard fan, and those new to Shriekback would be better off with any of the other compilations floating around.
