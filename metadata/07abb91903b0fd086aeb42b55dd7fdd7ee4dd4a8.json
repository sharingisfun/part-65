A visit from his only living relative reveals the truth. Nick has inherited the ability to see supernatural creatures, and as a &quot;Grimm,&quot; he is tasked with keeping the balance between mankind and the mythological. A reformed &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; becomes his greatest (and also reluctant) ally and confidant. It's not long before his work as a policeman leads Nick to the criminals he once thought were only found in fairy tales.
