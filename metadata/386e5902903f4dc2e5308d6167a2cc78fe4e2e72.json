If you need any help with installation, as I said, I am on youtube and i have uploaded videos of using this. Take note that this is a GM, but a GM is the same as the final version, just for devs. So, no you don't need to install this then go and buy the $30 application on the 26th. Just install this and that's it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386e5902903f4dc2e5308d6167a2cc78fe4e2e72","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Lion+%28GM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386e5902903f4dc2e5308d6167a2cc78fe4e2e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,110,89,2,144,63,77,194,229,48,141,97,103,162,204,120,254,78,46,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
