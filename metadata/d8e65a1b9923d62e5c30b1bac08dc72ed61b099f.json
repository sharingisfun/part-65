The straight-forward daring feel and lyrics show off the three membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ exceptional vocals. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby StepsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a mid-tempo groove with a strong R&amp;B style. Ã¢â‚¬Å“OMGÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an electronic-retro pop track with a unique sound, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love SickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is about a shy girl who learns about love through her first crush. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Goodbye, HelloÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a track with a shuffle rhythm about not being able to believe that they just went through a break-up the day before.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nAll tracks are from the iTune release and are all in 320Kbps MP3 format for your listening enjoyment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8e65a1b9923d62e5c30b1bac08dc72ed61b099f","amp;dn":"Girls%27+Generation+%28TaeTiSeo%29+-+Twinkle+%28320kbps%29+%28mini-album%29+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8e65a1b9923d62e5c30b1bac08dc72ed61b099f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,230,90,27,153,35,214,46,92,48,177,186,192,141,199,46,214,27,9,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
