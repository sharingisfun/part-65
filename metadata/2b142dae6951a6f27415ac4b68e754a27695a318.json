It actually retrieves the site dynamically from the original source.\nWith software like this installed all over the world, TPB will be even more reachable. Since most censorship and blocks are based on domain name or IP (or both), it will be impossible for anyone to keep a list of proxies that reach TPB.\n\n\nRequirements:\n\nA Linux machine (preferably Debian based) running the Apache web server.\nIt must have unrestricted access to the TPB web site.\n\n\n\n\nNote: There is a missing period typo in the README.TPB.txt instruction file.\nWhere it says &quot;mimeconf&quot;, that should be &quot;mime.conf&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b142dae6951a6f27415ac4b68e754a27695a318","amp;dn":"CGIPROXY+2.1+patched+to+tailor+fit+ThePirateBay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b142dae6951a6f27415ac4b68e754a27695a318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,20,45,174,105,81,166,242,116,21,172,75,104,231,84,162,118,149,163,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
