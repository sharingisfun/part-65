Design and Build Your Ideal Entertainment Center, shows woodworkers how to design and construct an entertainment centre that will fit their own personal needs. Using step-by-step instructions and full-colour photos, they are shown how to install built-in cabinetry, how to create chases for wires and cables, and how to include specialty hardware. The ten projects include a variety of style - modular, mix-n-match, knock down and even an old ice box. Readers will end up with a one-of-a-kind entertainment centre suitable for all their needs.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 127 pages\n    * Publisher: Popular Woodworking Books (May 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1558706976\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1558706972","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90c512fe985411d3ec255cc295d4347791e24b5b","amp;dn":"Design+Build+Your+Ideal+Entertainment+Center%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90c512fe985411d3ec255cc295d4347791e24b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,197,18,254,152,84,17,211,236,37,92,194,149,212,52,119,145,226,75,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
