As his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to help out, his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) proves to be a less than ideal life partner for this particular crisis. All the while, Adam's overprotective mother Diane (Anjelica Huston) tries to overcome her son's continued attempts to keep her out of his life. As Adam begins to discover how hard it is to deal with his situation, and to maintain various relationships in his life, he begins seeing a young counselor (Anna Kendrick) who might prove to be just as helpful personally as she is professionally. Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall co-star as Adam's fellow chemotherapy patients.\n\nRipped with Autogk\n\nLength: 1 Hour 40 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 400\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 110kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a88609505450e365b709eb80c6a6785ca88f5e","amp;dn":"50%2F50%282011%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a88609505450e365b709eb80c6a6785ca88f5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,168,134,9,80,84,80,227,101,183,9,235,128,198,166,120,92,168,143,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
