Enjoy. \n\nDescription:\n\nTiny Trainz allows the user to drive and assortment of trains around household environments. Tiny Trainz comes with entertaining default courses, but the user can also design their own landscape using the movable objects in each room and then build track on anything they want utilising Tiny TrainzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ simplified track-laying system. These locations consist of 4 common household areas: a childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bedroom, the lounge room, the garage and the kitchen. Tiny Trainz starts off with the room selection Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where do you want to play?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, presenting them with the 4 rooms using a colourful, kid-friendly menu interface. Once a route has been selected, the user can then choose to drive the route or change its layout. This means that the user can modify the setup of their room and track over and over again for a unique Tiny Trainz experience.\n\nHow To Install:\n\nJust Open The Readme File NOT nfo file!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bfbb7f6ed34c448dc65a11f866ee743d7015f12","amp;dn":"My+First+Trainz+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bfbb7f6ed34c448dc65a11f866ee743d7015f12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,251,183,246,237,52,196,72,220,101,161,31,134,110,231,67,215,1,95,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
