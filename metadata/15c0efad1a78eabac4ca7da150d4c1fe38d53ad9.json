Their son, Barnabas, grows up to be a wealthy playboy in Collinsport, Maine and is the master of Collinwood Manor. He breaks the heart of a witch, Angelique Bouchard, who kills his parents, curses his family, with all his lovers leaping to their deaths from a nearby cliff and finally turns Barnabas into a vampire and buries him alive in a chained-coffin in the woods. In 1972, Barnabas is accidentally freed from his coffin by a group of construction workers. He sucks them dry of their blood and makes his way back to Collinwood Manor where he finds his once-magnificent mansion in ruin. The manor is currently occupied by Barnabas' dysfunctional descendants. Barnabas decides to restore his family name, but when Angelique discovers that he has escaped his shallow grave, she plots revenge and tries to win him back. He discovers that his family's fishing company is almost out of business because of Angelique's business. Dr. Hoffman then takes several pints of his blood to try to turn herself into a vampire, only to be discovered by Barnabas and presumbaly killed and dumping her body in the ocean. He then discovers David's father snooping around the study, trying to find his riches. Barnabas then gives a choice: stay and be a father or leave, the father choosing the later. It is then found that the Maggie/Victoria, was sent to a mental hospital by her parents for seeing Barnabas love, Josette, who killed herself because of Angelique's curse.
