I: Yang Zheng (Li Yapeng) recalls how he graduated in 1999, contacted his onetime college girlfriend Wenhui (Xu Jinglei) in the US in 2001 and married her when she returned to China in 2003. Since he has become a successful CEO, she has become a full-time housewife. But one evening, when he comes home intending to watch his favourite sports programme on TV as usual, suddenly he doesn't recognise the woman he married. And when he moves out to a hotel, she doesn't come looking for him. II: Wenhui, divorced and with two young twin sons, is working as a shopgirl in Shanghai, while Yang Zheng, about to be divorced, is a car mechanic in Beijing. Neither has seen the other for over a decade, but they both attend a 10th anniversary college reunion in Shanghai organised by their friend Jiawei (Cui Dazhi). They end up spending a whole night together, recalling past times and re-igniting old fires. III: Yang Zheng traces a drunken happy-birthday call from Wenhui to Bordeaux, and flies from Beijing to see her for the first time in over a decade. At Bordeaux train station, Wenhui is waiting to welcome Chuchu (Angelica He), the mistress of her boss Pan Xiao (Chapman To), head of specialist wine retailer YH Global. Wenhui introduces Yang as her boyfriend. She later tells Yang that Pan is actually her husband, not her boss. With Pan temporarily away, Wenhui, Yang and Chuchu spend time together.\n\n\n\nTitle ______________ Eternal Moment\nSource _____________ Blu-ray\nRelease ____________ 05-01-2012\nRipper _____________ Zoo\nRuntime ____________ 01:42:35\nVideo ______________ x264 @ 2,277 Kbps\nAudio ______________ AC3 6CH @ 448 Kbps\nResolution _________ 1280 x 544\nGenre ______________ Romance\nLanguage ___________ Chinese\nSubtitle ___________ English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b792f712f374671d4f3ef0d5c42c673d3255901","amp;dn":"Eternal.Moment.2011.720p.BDRip.x264.AC3-Zooc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b792f712f374671d4f3ef0d5c42c673d3255901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,121,47,113,47,55,70,113,212,243,239,13,92,66,198,115,211,37,89,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
