It is the original combat system of CQB, hand-to-hand combat and self-defense, employed by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).\n\nKAPAP fight tactics originated in the 1940's and were used by the Palmach (Jewish Strike Brigades) forces in fighting for the independence of the State of Israel. These Palmach units later formed the core of Israel's special units in the conventional military (IDF).\n\nKAPAP ACADEMY was founded by Albert Timen who served in one of Israel's elite Counter Terror units. Due to constant reaserch in this field he and other Instructors had modified and upgraeded the system to fit legal aspects of civilian self defense, as well as becoming applicable by Law Enforcement , Military and Security operators worldwide. The Academy is based in the United States and serves as an International Instructional institute operating and represented in more than 20 countries by local Instructors certified by KAPAP ACADEMY.\n\nKAPAP ACADEMY is staffed by former official Israeli Military and Police instructors in Counter Terror combatives (LOTAR). It is an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œall combatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ system ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a system totally dedicated to close combat and self-defense, with and without weapons. It has no sporting or competition aspect. Nor does it adhere to any classical/traditional school of thought.\n\nINCLUDED\n\nKapap - Israeli Counter Terrorism Training - Vol 1 to 3\nKapap - Israeli Special Forces - Combat Concepts - Vol 1 to 4\nKapap - Israeli Special Forces - Hand To Hand Combat - Vol 1 to 4\n\nThis is what is coming and more.\nIf you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 01 - Woodmaster Survival Skills\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 02 - The Edible Garden\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 03 - Ray Mears - World of Survival\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 04 - Ray Mears - Country Tracks\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 05 - Ray Mears - Extreme Survival\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 06 - Ray Mears - Real Heroes of Telemark\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 07 - Ray Mears - Bushcraft Series\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 08 - Ray Mears - Wild Food\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 09 - 50 Outdoor Skills ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Basic\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 10 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE1\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 11 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE2\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 12 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE3\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 13 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE4\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 14 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE5\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 15 - Growing Your Own Food\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 16 - Growing Your Own Drugs\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 17 - Permaculture and Organic Gardening\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 18 - Old McDonalds Backyard Farm\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 19 - First Aid - Includes Gunshot Wounds\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 20 - Make you own Electricity\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 21 - More Food Farming\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 22 - Pure Water for Life\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 23 - Self Defense - Easy Stuff for Beginners\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 24 - Self Defense - Street Survival &amp; Hapkido Self-Defense\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 25 - Self Defense - Krav Mag\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 26 - Firearm Tactics 2.1\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 27 - Gracie - Bully Proof\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 28 - Kapap - Israeli Special Forces\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 29 - SSS - Split Second Survival - Gun and Knife\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                         Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                               End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                                Pastueur Carl Gallops\n                                                                                      Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                    Current Bible Prophecy &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                  Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                              Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                         Chuck Missler - USA &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&lt;/a&gt;                                        Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;       Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
