The purpose of Raspberry Pi (the name of both the computer, and the non-profit foundation that designs and sells it) is to help kids get access to computers and learn programming, in schools and the 3rd world, but the Pi (ARM11, 128/256 MB RAM, HDMI, USB...) is powerful enough for a variety of other uses (emulation, NAS, HTPC, Office work...). \n\nMore info here: http://www.raspberrypi.org/\nFAQ: http://www.raspberrypi.org/?page_id=8\nWiki: http://elinux.org/RaspberryPiBoard\n\nDescription of this torrent by the VM's creator:\n&quot;VirtualBox Virtual Machine in which I have installed and configured Debian-i386, scratchbox2, qemu and the codesourcery toolchain so that it is possible to build software for the RaspberryPi (although no one actually has one, only a handful of alpha boards are in circulation right now).\nThis virtual machine should also be usable for other ARM based devices, especially if you have a rootfs and can seed the scratchbox2 environment (see http://russelldavis.org/2010/10/20/setting-up-scratchbox2-to-build-software-for-zubuntu/ &amp; http://russelldavis.org/2010/11/03/mounting-a-raw-disk-image/ &amp; http://russelldavis.org/2011/09/07/setting-up-scratchbox2-from-scratch-for-the-raspberry-pi/ ).&quot;\n\nPlease direct your questions/comments either to the VM creator's blog at  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://russelldavis.org/2011/09/10/virtualbox-vm-for-raspberrypi-development/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://russelldavis.org/2011/09/10/virtualbox-vm-for-raspberrypi-development/&lt;/a&gt;\nor to that VM's post on the Raspberry Pi forum at http://www.raspberrypi.org/?page_id=43&amp;mingleforumaction=viewtopic&amp;t=454.0\nComments here won't be closely monitored.\n\nThis is version 1.0 ( 2011-09-11) of the VM.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:189f9501fb5ea313801e31b7b8ab000cf5b55699","amp;dn":"Raspberry+Pi+VM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"189f9501fb5ea313801e31b7b8ab000cf5b55699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,159,149,1,251,94,163,19,128,30,49,183,184,171,0,12,245,181,86,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
