Initially repulsed by the idea of being with his own kind, Monty experiences unfamiliar feelings of attraction followed by reactionary denial and a long overdue look in the mirror at his own inferiority complex.\n\nA modern comedy with a dash of camp and a trace of glamour, Yellow Fever is an offbeat and witty portrayal of gay Chinese subculture in a European-dominated society.\n\nRaymond Yeung 1998 26 min.
