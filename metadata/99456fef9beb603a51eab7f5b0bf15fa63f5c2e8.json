While Jim is away, Gil Davis kills Skeeter and takes the horse. The Sheriff then arrests Jim for Skeeter's murder. But unknown to them, an outlaw witnessed the killing. \n\nviewer revnue\n\nHoot Gibson is not your average western hero. He looks more like the guy next door, only his face seems to be more made up, an inheritance from the silent films. He is a strong presence on the screen and you end up liking him. In this film he is a champion at the rodeos and takes the challenge to tame a wild Palomino horse. He also is accused of murder and has to prove his innocence. Stepin Fetchit plays a very funny guy, but his character reminds you too much of the indignity of slavery, so there is a certain sadness in it. If this film would have been made in the forties, it would have been considered a b western, but it was made in 1931 and it was a pioneer of a style.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.b-westerns.com/hgibson2.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.b-westerns.com/hgibson2.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99456fef9beb603a51eab7f5b0bf15fa63f5c2e8","amp;dn":"Wild+Horse+%7BHoot+Gibson%7D+Western+%5B1931%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99456fef9beb603a51eab7f5b0bf15fa63f5c2e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,69,111,239,155,235,96,58,81,234,183,245,176,191,21,250,99,245,194,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
