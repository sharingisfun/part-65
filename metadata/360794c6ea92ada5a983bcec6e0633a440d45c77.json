This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives. One thing about MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Journal that is a little different from other menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s magazines is that it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flaunt women to sell its issues.\n\n\n[/quote][/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:360794c6ea92ada5a983bcec6e0633a440d45c77","amp;dn":"Men%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s+Journal+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+October+2011-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"360794c6ea92ada5a983bcec6e0633a440d45c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,7,148,198,234,146,173,165,169,131,188,236,110,6,51,164,64,212,92,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
