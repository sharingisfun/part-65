Flux has the following features:\n\nDrag and drop design of web pages, you can do almost anything without touching or even seeing XHTML/CSS . But you can meddle with the code if you want.\n\nApply cool (or cheesy) effects to images from right within Flux.\nAttach funky javascript actions to your page without having a clue what you're doing.\n\nEmbed Quicktime Movies, Flash and other objects.\nEdit sites directly off FTP and SFTP \n\nCreate the whole site within the WYSIWYG editor, type in XHTML, or a bit of both. You can use one of the supplied templates to get you started, or just stare creatively at a blank page.\n\nWhat's New\n\nFix for editing some CSS with advanced gradient code.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.5 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab8ce5309ae6565f5fa4fac4cd0a83deea2963c","amp;dn":"Flux+vs.+3.1.46+%2B+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab8ce5309ae6565f5fa4fac4cd0a83deea2963c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,184,206,83,9,174,101,101,245,250,79,172,76,208,168,61,238,162,150,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
