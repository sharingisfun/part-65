Both Martin and Clea are hopeful that Jake will be able to go home as Jake's behavior is much more &quot;normal&quot; when his father is around. A potential obstacle is the yet unopened package sent to Martin via the facility from Abigail Kelsey, Martin's sister-in-law who once tried to get custody of Jake following Sarah's death. Martin is suspicious if only because he did not tell Abigail about Jake being taken away or about the evaluation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d18a7cbe64f48bc6c526112b803b245e26e2748a","amp;dn":"Touch.S01E05.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d18a7cbe64f48bc6c526112b803b245e26e2748a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,138,124,190,100,244,139,198,197,38,17,43,128,59,36,94,38,226,116,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
