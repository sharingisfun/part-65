The unmanned system is an integration of advanced technologies developed in communications, computing, and control areas. It is a useful testing ground for trialing and implementing modern control techniques despite the challenges introduced by the limitations on direct scalability between the systems of a small-scale rotorcraft and those of its full-scale counterpart. Included are detailed expositions of: systematic hardware construction;software systems integration;aerodynamic modeling; andautomatic flight control system design.Emphasis is placed on the cooperative control and flight formation of multiple UAVs, vision-based ground-target tracking, and landing on moving platforms. Other issues such as the development of indoor micro aerial vehicles (that have to operate without access to a global positioning system) and vision-based navigation are also discussed in depth. The text is rounded out with a presentation of possible future research directions for relevant fields of study. Unmanned Rotorcraft Systems will be of great value to practicing engineers in aerospace-related industries and to academic researchers from aerospace, electrical or mechanical engineering backgrounds working on the development of unmanned systems.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 287 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (June 9, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0857296345\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0857296344\n    * Product Dimensions: 9.2 x 6.3 x 0.8 inches ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe38144cdad7b19584a81aacda87cc624d8b0fd7","amp;dn":"Unmanned+Rotorcraft+Systems+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe38144cdad7b19584a81aacda87cc624d8b0fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,56,20,76,218,215,177,149,132,168,26,172,218,135,204,98,77,139,15,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
