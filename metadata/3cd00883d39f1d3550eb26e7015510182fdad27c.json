Shot for less than $6000 on a mini DV on real locations throughout Kathmandu, the story follows Krishna as he wavers between his ties as a father/husband and his work as a drug dealer in the red light district of Thamel. Krishna depends entirely on his instincts for survival, making him quick to act yet slow to think. It's this flaw which get's him into hot water, and turns one night of his life into a battle for survival. Can he escape his destiny?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cd00883d39f1d3550eb26e7015510182fdad27c","amp;dn":"Sick+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cd00883d39f1d3550eb26e7015510182fdad27c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,208,8,131,211,159,29,53,80,235,38,231,1,85,16,24,47,218,210,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
