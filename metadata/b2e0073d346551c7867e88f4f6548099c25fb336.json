The most reliable predictor of the future, Intrade.com, says the mandate is likely to be overturned. But what happens next? What about the rest of Obamacare?\n\nDr. Manisha Sharma from &quot;Doctors for America&quot; and John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis (and author of the new Independent Institute book, Priceless) debate government's role in healthcare.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Singer, a general surgeon from Arizona, argues government healthcare, even without Obamacare, already makes your doctor's visit look like a trip to the veterinarian.\n\nBut isn't &quot;free&quot; healthcare a good thing? Investor Cliff Asness explains the myths about &quot;free&quot; stuff.\n\nKaren Harned with the National Federation of Independent Businesses and small business owner Joe Olivo explain how Obamacare--and other laws that kick in once a business employs 50 people--encourages small businesses to stay small. That kills jobs.\n\nFinally, I'll talk about how popular parts of Obamacare, like the ban on insurance companies' discriminating against people with pre-existing condition, are as destructive as the mandate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e0073d346551c7867e88f4f6548099c25fb336","amp;dn":"20120621-Stossel-%5BObamacare+on+Trial%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e0073d346551c7867e88f4f6548099c25fb336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,224,7,61,52,101,81,199,134,126,136,244,246,84,128,153,194,95,179,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
