Farooq remains troubled by his  \n own inability to let go of the memories    \n of his dead parents in his ancestral which \n he continues to occupy and use as the      \n disturbing muse for his own writing. So    \n deeply ensconced in being haunted by his   \n own past, Farooq appears incapable of      \n fully living in the present, to the extent \n to which he proves powerless in responding \n to the possibility of sharing true love    \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            \n  IMDB Link :                               \n                                            \n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252475/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252475/&lt;/a&gt;   \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/9158/41627529.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/9158/41627529.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/8932/23981935.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/8932/23981935.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6333/97278973.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6333/97278973.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy another Non-Retail Quality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c02f5fd6e71b272afdcaae2d369e1c3e9ed401f","amp;dn":"Chaurahen+-+DVDRip+-+XviD+-+1CDRip+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c02f5fd6e71b272afdcaae2d369e1c3e9ed401f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,2,245,253,110,113,178,114,175,220,170,226,211,105,225,195,233,237,64,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
