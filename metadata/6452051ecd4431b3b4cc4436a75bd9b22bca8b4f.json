The aptly titled disc has a real circus quality to the sound, especially on the opener, &quot;Rigs of the Time&quot; and the more abstract &quot;Flash Company,&quot; which make full use of the mix of brass and strings. But this very ambitious full-length debut takes in a great deal, from the ballad &quot;Death and the Lady&quot; to the more gospel-ish &quot;Jordan&quot; (actually a shanty tweaked a little) and some instrumentals, like &quot;Sloe Gin&quot; that have been expanded from their original form to sound very full (as well they might with an 11-piece group). &quot;Courting Too Slow&quot; is revisited from an early Spiers &amp; Boden album, with Jon Boden showing just how his singing has improved, a mix of deep emotion and fairground barker. It's a record that's to be praised for the chances it takes -- they could have played it fairly safe and been praised as groundbreaking -- even though they don't all succeed. But even the failures, like the clumsy &quot;Flash Company&quot; are never less than interesting. Kudos to the producers, who bring clarity to a dense sound. This is a summation of the formation of this sound; where they take it will be the fascinating part. \n\ncd ripped by EAC on my mates computer\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/11/24/jon-boden/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6452051ecd4431b3b4cc4436a75bd9b22bca8b4f","amp;dn":"Bellowhead...Burlesque%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6452051ecd4431b3b4cc4436a75bd9b22bca8b4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,82,5,30,205,68,49,179,180,204,68,54,167,91,217,178,43,202,139,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
