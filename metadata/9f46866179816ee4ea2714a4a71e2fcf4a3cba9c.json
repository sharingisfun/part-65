They've &quot;made it&quot; all over Europe and have    \n    decided that a spooky old manoractually the rundown set from a        \n    rundown horror moviewould be the perfect place to continue the        \n    physical expression of their love. Naturally, the minute they settle     \n    into this moldy old abode, goofy ghoul stuff starts happening. Bill      \n    is raped by a trio of she-demons (he doesn't put up much of a fight).    \n    He also witnesses the Countess shape-shifting into a Count. Of           \n    course, the big surprise comes when the perplexed paramours want to      \n    leave. Instead of allowing them to check out, their scantily-clad        \n    hostess demands they take part in a Black Mass sex party that's so       \n    perverse that Anton LeVay would denounce it as &quot;disgusting.&quot; All Bill    \n    and Lisa wanted was an atmospheric place to gyrate their genitals;       \n    what they got instead was Terror at Orgy Castle.                         \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
