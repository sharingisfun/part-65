The local Toronto band became a phenomenon in 1991/92 with this short collection of songs that were flogged at local concerts and independent record stores around time. It was the first demo tape to go platinum in Canada (more than 100,000 units sold). \n\nThe files in mp3 format are pretty hard to track down, so I thought I'd up them. \n\nThe sound is unpolished, acoustic, organic perfection. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0abc74dc475ad8ef822c70009835efb89e48d466","amp;dn":"Barenaked+Ladies+-+The+Yellow+Tape+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0abc74dc475ad8ef822c70009835efb89e48d466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,188,116,220,71,90,216,239,130,44,112,0,152,53,239,184,158,72,212,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
