With the coincidental release of P.O.D.'s &quot;Satellite&quot; album on 9/11/01 a somewhat successful San Diego band rocketed to the top of the charts and inspired millions to truly feel &quot;Alive&quot;\n\nThis fanmade album commemorates that occasion and pays tribute to the fallen thru songs like &quot;America&quot; featuring guitar legend Santana and a special World Trade Center mix of &quot;Ghetto&quot;. I also included their new 2011 song...21 tracks in all\n\n\nTo quote one of those songs,&quot;I believe this world believes in love&quot;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04e93f371df269db8d72adde100f5695977f93c1","amp;dn":"P.O.D.+Satellite+2.0+%2810th+Anniversary+911+Commemorative+album%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04e93f371df269db8d72adde100f5695977f93c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,233,63,55,29,242,105,219,141,114,173,222,16,15,86,149,151,127,147,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
