This broad-ranging treatment is the first to synthesise current understanding of all types of cold-water coral, covering their ecology, biology, palaeontology and geology. Beginning with a history of research in the field, the authors describe the approaches needed to study corals in the deep sea. They consider coral habitats created by stony scleractinian as well as octocoral species. The importance of corals as long-lived geological structures and palaeoclimate archives is discussed, in addition to ways in which they can be conserved. Topic boxes explain unfamiliar concepts, and case studies summarize significant studies, coral habitats or particular conservation measures. Written for professionals and students of marine science, this text is enhanced by an extensive glossary, online resources, and a unique collection of color photographs and illustrations of corals and the habitats they form.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 352 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (May 25, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521884853\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521884853","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8faa168a62623722da655ac4ed341918c0872a","amp;dn":"Cold-Water+Corals+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8faa168a62623722da655ac4ed341918c0872a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,143,170,22,138,98,98,55,34,218,101,90,196,237,52,25,24,192,135,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
