Program Verification is the area of computer science that studies mathematical methods for checking that a program conforms to its specification. This text is a self-contained introduction to program verification using logic-based methods, presented in the broader context of formal methods for software engineering. The idea of specifying the behaviour of individual software components by attaching contracts to them is now a widely followed approach in program development, which has given rise notably to the development of a number of behavioural interface specification languages and program verification tools. A foundation for the static verification of programs based on contract-annotated routines is laid out in the book. These can be independently verified, which provides a modular approach to the verification of software. The text assumes only basic knowledge of standard mathematical concepts that should be familiar to any computer science student. It includes a self-contained introduction to propositional logic and first-order reasoning with theories, followed by a study of program verification that combines theoretical and practical aspects -- from a program logic (a variant of Hoare logic for programs containing user-provided annotations) to the use of a realistic tool for the verification of C programs (annotated using the ACSL specification language), through the generation of verification conditions and the static verification of runtime errors.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 320 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (January 11, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0857290177\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0857290175","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9508ba23139341db5c53a0313b044103601f93be","amp;dn":"Rigorous+Software+Development+-+An+Intro+to+Program+Verification","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9508ba23139341db5c53a0313b044103601f93be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,8,186,35,19,147,65,219,92,83,160,49,59,4,65,3,96,31,147,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
