Unlike other animated series based on Bible stories, these programs are not based on modern characters interacting with Biblical figures, but rather provide dramatic retelling of the Bible stories themselves. The series was created to be a non-denominational informative and educational tool to help parents, caregivers, and educators instill positive spiritual values and character traits to those in their care.\n\n\nThe series was directed by Richard Rich, the ex-Disney director who also directed The Swan Princess trilogy, and other animated educational programs such as the Animated Hero Classics and the K10C: KidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ten Commandments.\n\n12 Miracles Jesus\n13 The Greatest Is the Least\n14 The King is born\n15 The Kingdom of Heaven\n16 The LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prayer\n17 The Lost is found\n18 The Messiah Comes\n19 The Ministry of Paul\n20 The Righteous Judge\n21 Treasures in Heaven\n22 Worthy is The Lamb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faae81a0808c18d12f634a4b10ee4fb9d2001762","amp;dn":"Animated+Stories+from+the+New+Testament+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faae81a0808c18d12f634a4b10ee4fb9d2001762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,174,129,160,128,140,24,209,47,99,74,75,16,238,79,185,210,0,23,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
