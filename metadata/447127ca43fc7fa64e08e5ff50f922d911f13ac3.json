They are \n       giving up everything and going back in time to live like Victorian \n       hill farmers. For one month, they are stuck on a hill farm in \n       Snowdonia, North Wales.\n       \n       Tommy, Leah, Ela and Jac leave all their games and gadgets behind \n       and go back 120 years to their Victorian homes. Everything is \n       different; they are sharing beds, sharing a tin bath and even \n       sharing a potty. There is no fridge, computer or even a shower, \n       because they haven't been invented yet.\n       \n       This is 1890, so if they get peckish, the milk is in the cow and \n       the eggs are in the chicken. They have to learn how to farm \n       Victorian-style, and for 21st century families who don't know one \n       end of a cow from the &quot;udder&quot;, it's a real challenge.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;22644d504147624a57514a0c434b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447127ca43fc7fa64e08e5ff50f922d911f13ac3","amp;dn":"Stuck.On.Sheep.Mountain.S01E01.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447127ca43fc7fa64e08e5ff50f922d911f13ac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,113,39,202,67,252,127,166,78,8,229,255,80,249,34,217,17,241,58,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
