Entertainment. It is an American dark comedy which heavily parodies the horror, slasher, and mystery genres. Several mid- and late-90s films and TV shows are spoofed, most predominantly Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, along with The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project, and Dawson's Creek.\n\nThe tagline reads &quot;No mercy. No shame. No sequel.&quot;, the last reference being an ironic nod towards the tendency of popular horror movies becoming cash cow franchises. 2001 saw the release of Scary Movie 2, with the appropriate tagline &quot;We lied&quot;. Later video covers of the first film frequently drop the tagline's third statement. The film was originally titled &quot;Last Summer I Screamed Because Halloween Fell on Friday the 13th&quot;. Scary Movie was followed by three more sequels Scary Movie 2 (2001), Scary Movie 3 (2003), and Scary Movie 4 (2006). Its title serves as a homage to the production title of Scream, which was also released through Dimension Films. In early 2013, Scary Movie 5 will be released.\n\nPlz Seed For Others   Thnx :-}","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ecd483e258247720f39f2748b0b2fd1e0205c52","amp;dn":"Scary+Movie+++%28DVDrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ecd483e258247720f39f2748b0b2fd1e0205c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,205,72,62,37,130,71,114,15,57,242,116,139,11,47,209,224,32,92,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
