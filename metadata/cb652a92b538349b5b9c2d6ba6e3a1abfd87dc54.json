At a little over six feet tall and five feet wide, it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the strangest heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d ever seen, but close. A girl with a wounded, sack-like face; a boy with pinhole eyes and a cruel sneer; and a distant shadow peering out from behind a dying tree, all stared back at him.\n\nYet it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t only the subjects that challenged him, but the note that came with the anonymous painting.\n\n&quot;Here in Art, Denial.&quot;\n\nFor professor Daniel Rineheart, these four words herald a riddle that sets off a surreal nightmare. Where objects from his past manifest in canvas and oil. Where painted clocks tick-tock away in the dark hours before dawn and a missing dog whimpers from between the walls. Where the painted subjects themselves leave the canvas to stalk the halls of his once quiet house.\n\nAnd where all answers lead back to a blind artist and an impossible creation, one that threatens to destroy his family and devour his sanity.\n\n- - - - - - - \n\nFORSAKEN is a dark novel, a throwback to the haunted tales that slowly boil and get beneath the skin, sticking with the reader far after the pages are closed and the story's concluded. It's a dark tale that blends the line between the psychological and the supernatural, and challenges the reader to descend into a maddening world where past and present blend together, where the blind see far beyond the living veil, and where evil comes alive in oil and art.\n\n- - - - - - - \n\nWhile I have made this eBook free for the online community, I hope you will consider supporting creativity by purchasing a copy for a friend if you enjoy it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb652a92b538349b5b9c2d6ba6e3a1abfd87dc54","amp;dn":"Forsaken+Pirate+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb652a92b538349b5b9c2d6ba6e3a1abfd87dc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,101,42,146,181,56,52,155,91,156,45,107,166,227,161,171,253,135,220,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
