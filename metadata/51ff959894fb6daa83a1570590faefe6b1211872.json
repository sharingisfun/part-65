The length of the war and differing opinions on what should be done to bring the war to an end has led to a splintering of the groups involved. The controlling powers-that-be have depleted arsenals and seemed to have exhausted all efforts of diplomacy. Trapped in a stalemate, sub-factions have rebelled and broken off the main alignments. Rebellion is upon us.\n\nSins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion further expands on the Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion legacy with six massive Titans, three new capital ships, new corvette-class ships, and many other gameplay enhancements as well as graphic engine, AI and multiplayer upgrades. A stand-alone release that also contains all of the previous Solar Empire content, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion serves as both a sequel and a reinvention of the acclaimed 4X space strategy game.\n\n[b]Features:[/b]\n\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Play as one of three unique races Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the TEC, the Advent or the Vasari; then customize your faction and unlock new options by declaring yourself loyalist, rebel or neutral.\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Updated graphics bring Sins of a Solar Empire to life as never before, with new particle effects, enhanced textures, and improved shading.\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Six massive Titans enter the fray Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each with upgradable special abilities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ give loyalist and rebel factions a late-game way to eliminate powerful foes.\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Three new capital ships bring immediate options to the table, offering even greater strategic depth; while existing capital ships have been rebalanced for their roles.\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ New technologies grant loyalist and rebel factions new ways to advance towards the ultimate victory!\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ New corvette class ships use their enhanced speed and maneuverability to weave through the battlefield, inflicting damage to enemy shipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ systems.\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ AI enhancements make single-player games more fun and challenging than ever.\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Multiplayer optimizations for Ironclad Online make getting games set up simple.\n- REBELLION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ New victory conditions provide multiple paths towards becoming emperor of the galaxy.\n- Explore the epic scale of a dynamic 3D galaxy featuring planets, asteroids, plasma storms, stars and more.\n- Take on multiple roles as you seamlessly transition between the role of emperor and fleet commander using SinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unique strategic zoom.\n- Extensive diplomatic and economic strategies are yours to wield to your advantage.
