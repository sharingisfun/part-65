The Crimea serves well for both Paris and the Riviera in this opulently staged film about idle bourgeois life in the salons of Paris. Film critic and screenwriter Valentin Turkin wrote in 1918, &quot;Everyone remembers the characters in Bauer's films, figures quietly slipping by or sitting, lost in thought, the tardy, passionate, first embrace of lovers, life quietly passing by, suddenly interrupted by a cry, a fall, death, which leaves in its wake peace and loneliness in empty halls and at the silent cemetery.&quot; Bauer died following an accident during the making of The King of Paris and the film was completed by the actress Ol'ga Rakhmanova, making her the first Russian woman director.\n\n      1917\nYevgeni Bauer\nKorol Parizha\nsrt english\n\n\n King of Paris (1917) EG\\Yevgeni Bauer - Korol Parizha - The King of Paris (1917) EG.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 836 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 2mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 866 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 2mn\n      Bit rate : 1 730 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.225\n      Stream size : 776 MiB (93%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.3 (UTC 2008-06-07)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 2mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 57.4 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªÃƒâ€šÃ‚Âª\fÃƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â hÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7adec0f0b34962df00aae9b14b6dbfd71ea0276","amp;dn":"Yevgeni+Bauer+-+Korol+Parizha+-+The+King+of+Paris+%281917%29+EG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7adec0f0b34962df00aae9b14b6dbfd71ea0276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,173,236,15,11,52,150,45,240,10,174,155,20,182,219,253,113,234,2,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
