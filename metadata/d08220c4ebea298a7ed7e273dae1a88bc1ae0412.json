Orbison grew up in Texas and began singing in a rockabilly-country &amp; western band\nin high school until he was signed by Sun Records in Memphis. His greatest success came\nwith Monument Records in the early to mid 1960s when 22 of his songs placed on the\nBillboard Top Forty, including &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;, &quot;Crying&quot;, &quot;In Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Oh, Pretty\nWoman&quot; His career stagnated through the 1970s, but several covers of his songs and the\nuse of one in a film by David Lynch revived his career in the 1980s. In 1988, he joined the\nsupergroup Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne\nand also released a new solo album. He died of a heart attack in December that year, at the\nzenith of his resurgence. His life was marred by tragedy, including the death of his first wife\nand two of his children in separate accidents.\n\nOrbison was a natural baritone, but music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or\nfour-octave range.The combination of Orbison's powerful, impassioned voice and complex\nmusical arrangements led many critics to refer to his music as operatic, giving him the\nsobriquet &quot;the Caruso of Rock&quot;.Performers such as Elvis Presley and Bono both stated his\nvoice was the greatest and most distinctive they had ever heard.While most men in rock and\nroll in the 1950s and 1960s portrayed a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs instead\nconveyed a quiet, desperate vulnerability. He was known for performing while standing still\nand solitary, wearing black clothes and dark sunglasses which lent an air of mystery to his\npersona.\n\nOrbison was initiated into the second class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 by\nlongtime admirer Bruce Springsteen. The same year he was inducted into the Nashville\nSongwriters Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone placed Orbison at number 37 in their list of The\nGreatest Artists of All Time. In 2002, Billboard magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the\nTop 600 recording artists.Rolling Stone rated Orbison number 13 in their list of The 100\nGreatest Singers of All Time in 2008.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Orbison&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Orbison&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  01 - Uptown                                    [02:05]\n  02 - Only The Lonely                           [02:25]\n  03 - Blue Angel                                [02:43]\n  04 - I'm Hurtin'                               [02:47]\n  05 - Running Scared                            [02:11]\n  06 - Lana                                      [02:17]\n  07 - Crying                                    [02:45]\n  08 - Let The Good Times Roll                   [02:31]\n  09 - Blue Bayou                                [02:31]\n  10 - Dream Baby                                [02:33]\n  11 - The Crowd                                 [02:23]\n  12 - Working For The Man                       [02:27]\n  13 - In Dreams                                 [02:49]\n  14 - Falling                                   [02:23]\n  15 - It's Over                                 [02:47]\n  16 - Oh, Pretty Woman                          [02:58]\n  17 - Goodnight                                 [02:30]\n  18 - Pretty Paper [Bonus Track]                [02:46]\n  19 - (Say) You're My Girl [Bonus Track]        [02:47]\n  20 - Paper Boy [Bonus Track]                   [02:09]\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 50:57\nTotal Size...........: 155.60 MB\n\n\nRipper.......: EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC - 8 - oan\n\nCodec........: Free Lossless Audio Codec [FLAC]\n\nVersion......: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nQuality......: Lossless, [avg. compression: 63 %]\n\nChannels.....: Mono / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nTags.........: VorbisComment\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan) on 10/09/2011\n\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 15/09/2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d08220c4ebea298a7ed7e273dae1a88bc1ae0412","amp;dn":"Roy+Orbison+-++Monument+Singles++2011+%5BEAC+-+FLAC+-+LYRICS%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d08220c4ebea298a7ed7e273dae1a88bc1ae0412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,130,32,196,235,234,41,138,126,215,226,115,218,225,168,139,193,174,4,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
