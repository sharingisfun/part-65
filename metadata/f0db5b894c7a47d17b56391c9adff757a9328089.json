A young and benign ruler meets for the first time \nthe aged and practically forgotten titular figure while taking stock of his\nemployees; their conversation reveals that the old man has been having ghostly\nvisitations in the crypt by the ruler's ancestors every night for the last 30\nyears and, even more distressingly, that they have lately taken to calling for \nthe young king to come join them. \n\nWhen the latter absents himself for a little while, the warden is joined by an \narrogant and bullying member of the Royal family (the king's brother-in-law?) who, \nwith the sinister court adviser (having been witness to the previous encounter), \nconspires against the throne. He mentions in passing the doppelganger nature of\nthe regent but, just then, the latter returns to find the old man almost on the\npoint of dying. As the warden is carried out by the royal attendants with the\nruler following them, the latter's consort enters the room herself: &quot;This Autumn\nis sad beyond belief&quot;.\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
