Any posts made there will be made here on TPB after an outage (I interact via SSL only, which was down earlier this week increasing my typical delay).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:254e179fbbad0485ee78479f1fc1109ba77c064c","amp;dn":"20110714-Stossel-%5BHerman+Cain+2012%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"254e179fbbad0485ee78479f1fc1109ba77c064c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,78,23,159,187,173,4,133,238,120,71,159,31,193,16,155,167,124,6,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
