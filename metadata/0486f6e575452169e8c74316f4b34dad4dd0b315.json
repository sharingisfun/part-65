It's been a long time since Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) escaped from Guantanamo Bay, and these days they're just not as tight as they used to be. But as they each prepare to celebrate Christmas Eve with their new best buds, Kumar receives a very special delivery that should have gone to Harold. Always the dutiful friend, Kumar does his best to see that the package reaches its intended destination by the time sleigh bells start ringing. Unfortunately, while making the delivery Kumar causes Harold's family Christmas tree to go up in flames. Thankfully for Harold, the in-laws are away for the evening, giving him just enough time to track down a replacement and avoid the wrath of his wife's temperamental father. With the clock counting down to Christmas and the family returning home soon, Harold and Kumar race though New York City on a mad dash to find the perfect substitute tree. Neil Patrick Harris returns for more raunchy fun in a sequel also featuring Danneel Harris, David Krumholtz, and Eddie Kaye Thomas. \n\nLength: 1 Hour 30 Minutes\n\nFrame Width: 608\n\nFrame Height: 256\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 176kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0486f6e575452169e8c74316f4b34dad4dd0b315","amp;dn":"A+Very+Harold+and+Kumar+Christmas%282011%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0486f6e575452169e8c74316f4b34dad4dd0b315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,134,246,229,117,69,33,105,232,199,67,22,244,179,77,173,77,208,179,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
