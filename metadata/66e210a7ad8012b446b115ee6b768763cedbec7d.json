Unlike the first one, Classical Variations and Themes, Hymn to Life does not present Tolkki as a fast and classical heavy metal guitarist, but as a diverse songwriter. The album deals with Tolkki's personal beliefs and thoughts about life and encourages the listener to believe in him/herself. Despite some song names, Tolkki uses strong criticism against religions.\n\nTracklist:\n\n    &quot;Primal (intro)&quot;\n    &quot;Key to the Universe&quot;\n    &quot;Now I Understand&quot;\n    &quot;Divine&quot;\n    &quot;Little Boy I Miss You&quot;\n    &quot;I Believe&quot;\n    &quot;Are You the One?&quot;\n    &quot;Father&quot;\n    &quot;Fresh Blue Waters&quot;\n    &quot;Dear God&quot;\n    &quot;It's Xmas Morning&quot;\n    &quot;Hymn to life&quot;\n\nCredits:\n\n    Timo Tolkki - composer, guitar, bass, vocals, keyboards \n    Anssi NykÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nen - drums\n    Mika Ervaskari - piano, keyboards\n    Michael Kiske - vocals on track 2\n    Sharon den Adel - vocals on track 7\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e210a7ad8012b446b115ee6b768763cedbec7d","amp;dn":"Timo+Tolkki+-+Hymn+To+Life+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e210a7ad8012b446b115ee6b768763cedbec7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,226,16,167,173,128,18,180,70,177,21,238,107,118,135,99,206,219,236,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
