The modern Mexican UFO wave, along with JaimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement in this field, began in July 1991 during a total solar eclipse, when thousands of Mexican citizens reported and filmed UFOs. This was the event that made the UFO phenomenon a reality to Jaime. Through his Tercer Milenio TV program, Jaime continues to report on UFOs on a regular basis and is one of the hardest-working investigators and reporters in the field.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6fc3d7e629968a4b9db674daa2207814c3a2746","amp;dn":"Jaime+Maussan+-+IUFOC+2012+-+Imminent+Contact","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6fc3d7e629968a4b9db674daa2207814c3a2746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,252,61,126,98,153,104,164,185,219,103,77,170,34,7,129,76,58,39,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
