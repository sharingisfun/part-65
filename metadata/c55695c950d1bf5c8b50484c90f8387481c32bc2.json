Now she has come to visit Chile with Wil, her American boyfriend, and to meet up with Ana, her childhood friend. Ana is the Chilean daughter of diplomats who spent part of her youth in the US, and now lives in Chile. The three have decided to hike up to the El Morado Glacier, high up in the Chilean Andes. An accident, however, obliges them to turn back in search of help. On the way, they find the isolated cabin of a goatherd. What seems like the solution to all their problems becomes the beginning of the worst nightmare of their lives. The sociopathic goatherd kidnaps them and makes them victim to his macabre games.
