Support comes from his sister, a lab tech, the Hemlock Society president, and a lawyer. The child of survivors of the Armenian genocide interviews applicants: his sister video tapes them. He assembles a device allowing a person to initiate a three-chemical intravenous drip. The local D.A., the governor, and the Legislature respond. In court scenes, Kevorkian is sometimes antic. He's single-minded about giving dying individuals the right to determine how their lives will end. He wants the Supreme Court to rule. He picks a fight he can't win: is it hubris or heroism?\n\n\n..:: Cast ::..\n\nAl Pacino - Jack Kevorkian\nBrenda Vaccaro - Margo Janus\nJohn Goodman - Neal Nicol\nDeirdre O'Connell - Linda\nTodd Susman - Stan Levy\n\n\n..:: Info ::..\n\nOriginal Title: You Don't Know Jack\nCreator: Barry Levinson\nYear: 2010\nCategory: Biography / Drama\nRuntime: 134 min\nAspect Ratio: Widescreen 2.40:1 Anamorphic; PAL\nAudio: DD5.1: English  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ French  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ DD2.0: Spanish  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Hungarian  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Czech  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Polish (lektor) \nSubtitles: Spanish  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Norwegian  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Swedish  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Danish  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Finnish  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Dutch  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Portuguese  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Hungarian  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ French  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Polish  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Czech  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Greek  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Turkish  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Romanian  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ English for the Hearing Impaired \nVideo: Untouched\nMenu: Yes\nSpecial Features:\nInteractive Menu\nScene Selection\nThe Real Jack / Inner Circle\nProgram Used: AnyDVD + ImgBurn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9044ae9f13987ae2e9bc0503f470f5d935d60dc6","amp;dn":"You+Don%27t+Know+Jack+%282010%29+DVD9+PAL+MultiSUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9044ae9f13987ae2e9bc0503f470f5d935d60dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,68,174,159,19,152,122,226,233,188,5,3,244,112,245,217,53,214,13,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
