Set in a world of great castles and strange machinery, three heroes are bound to a mysterious device called the Trine in a quest to save the kingdom from evilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nThe gameplay is based on fully interactive physics - each character\\'s different abilities help the player battle an army of undead and defeat hazardous contraptions. The player can at any time freely choose whoever is best suited for the upcoming challenge or puzzle: The Wizard is able to summon objects to help solve puzzles and create new ways to overcome obstacles, the Thief uses her agility and dead-on accuracy to swiftly surprise the monsters, and the Knight unleashes mayhem and physical destruction wherever he goes.\n\nThis is absolutely tested by me and it\\'s the full game. I\\'m pretty sure people can trust my opinion.\n\n\nDeveloper: Frozenbyte\nPublisher:\tNobilis, SouthPeak Interactive, Steam, Direct2Drive, Gamers Gate, Impulse Loaded\nPlatforms: Windows, Mac, Linux\nRelease: July 3, 2009\nGerne: Platform, Puzzle\nMode: SP, MP\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\nWindows XP/Vista/7:\n2.0 GHz processor (dual-core recommended)\n512 MB system RAM (1 GB Vista/7)\nRadeon X800 / GeForce 6800 or better\nDirectX 9.0c\n600MB HDD space\n\nLinux:\n2.0 GHz processor (dual-core recommended)\n1GB system RAM\nRadeon HD 2800 or GeForce 6800 or better with Shader Model 3.0 support\nRequires official Catalyst drivers or NVIDIA drivers - will not run on Radeon 500 series (up to X1800 cards).\n600-1100 MB HDD space\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen002.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen002.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen001.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen001.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen020.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen020.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen023.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/2009/186/959287_20090706_790screen023.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n1.
