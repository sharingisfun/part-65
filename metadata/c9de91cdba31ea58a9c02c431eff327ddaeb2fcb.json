It puts an icon in the System-Tray next to the clock on your taskbar.\nBy clicking this icon, you get fast and easy access to some system functions:\n\n- Wallpaper Changer; will let you select which pictures you want to use as desktop background, and change between them in specified intervals.\n\n- Log off, Reboot, Shut down, or Stand by; all with 1 click. And with a little tweak so you can force Windows to terminate.\n\n\n\nEasyCopy is also a small, fast and efficient tool, designed for your everyday backups, copying, moving around with files, etc...\n\nBoth tools are made to be as easy to use as possible; no manuals or help-files needed.\nThis version of EasyTools now also supports EasyCopy, and will provide you with quick access to your queued EasyCopy-jobs.\n\n\n/Ubehage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9de91cdba31ea58a9c02c431eff327ddaeb2fcb","amp;dn":"Ubehage%5C%27s+EasyTools+v1.20+with+EasyCopy+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9de91cdba31ea58a9c02c431eff327ddaeb2fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,222,145,205,186,49,234,88,169,192,44,67,30,255,50,125,218,235,47,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
