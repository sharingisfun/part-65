Until then, Kaoru was an honor roll student who tended to keep to himself, but meeting notorious bad boy Sentaro Kawabuchi starts to change him. Through his devil-may-care classmate, Kaoru learns the attractions of jazz and finds the first person he can call a &quot;friend&quot;. He also discovers how much fun it is to play music with a pal. \n\nOther characters include Sentaro's kind childhood chum, Ritsuko, who is the daughter of a record shop owner; the mysterious upperclassman, Yurika; and Brother Jun, the much-admired leader among their peers. Set against the backdrop of a seaside town with a scent of American culture, this series is a drama about young people coming into their own, crossing each other's paths, and finding friendship, love, and music! \n\nRelease date : June 22, 2012\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\nGenres : Drama, Historical, Romance, School, Slice of Life, Josei\n\nThemes : coming of age, music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146837cc6f063a9df68ed8b37eba795837c5c1bb","amp;dn":"%5BWhyNot%5D+Sakamichi+no+Apollon+-+11+%5B80148B2A%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146837cc6f063a9df68ed8b37eba795837c5c1bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,104,55,204,111,6,58,157,246,142,216,179,126,186,121,88,55,197,193,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
