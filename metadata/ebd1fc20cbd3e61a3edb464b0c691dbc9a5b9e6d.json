It was a period of mutual suspicion and paranoia that later became known as &quot;The Great Game&quot;. Afghanistan was perceived by Victorian Britain, as it's believed to be today, to be an immediate threat to British national security. In this first film, Rory Stewart tells the story of the decision-making that led to the first British invasion of Afghanistan, and the three Anglo-Afghan wars fought in this era. And he tells the story of Afghanistan's unlikely reaction to this period. When an Afghan-elite made a futile attempt to impose western-inspired ideas and modernity on the country.\n\nSoldiers and generals from both sides tell how the Soviets were sucked into invading Afghanistan and the parallels that conflict shares with the current American-led intervention.\n\n\nAfghanistan - The Great Game - A Personal View By Rory Stewart - S01 - E01\nAfghanistan - The Great Game - A Personal View By Rory Stewart - S01 - E02\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 59mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 538 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\nAudio\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 1h 9mn\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 115 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd1fc20cbd3e61a3edb464b0c691dbc9a5b9e6d","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Afghanistan+-The+Great+Game++-+TVrips+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd1fc20cbd3e61a3edb464b0c691dbc9a5b9e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,209,252,32,203,211,230,26,62,219,70,75,12,105,29,188,154,91,158,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
