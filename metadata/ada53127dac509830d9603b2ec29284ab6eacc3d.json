However, when they encounter his friend and neighbor Debbie, they assume that she is the lover he has invited them to meet, and she assumes that the favor Matt intends to ask her is not to cook dinner for everyone, but to act as his &quot;beard&quot; and pretend she is really his girlfriend so his parents don't find out that he's gay.\n\nThe confusion that follows contains all the elements of a traditional farce with a decidedly gay twist: slamming doors, innuendo and double entendre, romance, mistaken identities, and a climax designed to leave the audience rolling in the aisles.\n\nAlso includes a PDF copy of the original script and information on amateur performance rights.\n\nCast:\n\nMatthew Lyons:\tPhil Hopf\nDebbie Morgan:\tKimberly Kracke\nEsther Lyons:\tCarol Heney\nHenry Lyons:\tJohn Weiner\nHarry Lyons:\tDanny Vivona\nJared Hart:\tA.J.
