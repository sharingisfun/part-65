Over the years the Ashampoo programmers have turned the program into a full suite that can handle all your data, audio and video burning and authoring tasks, without sacrificing its famous ease of use. In version 10 they have once again added a wealth of new features and modules, but the program is still amazingly intuitive to use everything is explained as you do it.\n\nThe main focus of this premium version is even better authoring capabilities for building video and audio discs using the latest formats. HD and Full HD video (720p and 1080p) are now fully supported for Blu-ray discs, and all the encoding is handled by Ashampoo Burning Studio 10. All the authoring tools have been overhauled and the video encoding quality is even better than before. You now use the same new integrated editor for building DVD and Blu-ray video disks with menus. The program also starts more quickly and is generally snappier to use.\n\nIn addition to this there is a new Autoplay Editor module with which you can build auto-starting data discs with attractive interactive menus for example for collections of programs. And there is now also a new Audio Player with which you can play audio files and audio CDs without leaving the program.\n\nInstallation:\n1) Run ashampoo_burning_studio_10_10.0.11_sm.exe to install the program.\n2) Exit program after completing installation.\n3) Copy the file ash_inet2.dll in folder 'Patch' into installation folder and confirm replacing.\n4) Run the program and go to Help and click on Buy and Activate.\n5) Enter the serial below and click on Activate Now button.\nBS10A8-7770E2-326CC8\n\nEnjoy..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290f5eccf71fb0f1b3e73e5cf4c646fdcfbeb191","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Burning+Studio+10.0.11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290f5eccf71fb0f1b3e73e5cf4c646fdcfbeb191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,15,94,204,247,31,176,241,179,231,62,92,244,198,70,253,207,190,177,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
