In particular, this book looks at the internal EU decision-making process with regard to international negotiations that lead to multilateral environmental agreements. By studying eight such decision-making processes, the book explains how much negotiation autonomy (or 'discretion') the EU negotiator (the European Commission or the Council Presidency) enjoys vis-a-vis the member states it represents and how this particular degree of discretion can be explained. The book's empirical evidence is based on extensive literature review, primary and semi-confidential document research, as well as interviews with EU decision-makers. It is aimed at a readership interested in EU politics and decision-making, global/multilateral governance, environmental policy science and methodological development of Qualitative Comparative Analysis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d62bc91d69b6fe4a11ba7627886e620d23276d","amp;dn":"The+EU+as+International+Environmental+Negotiator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d62bc91d69b6fe4a11ba7627886e620d23276d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,214,43,201,29,105,182,254,74,17,186,118,39,136,110,98,13,35,39,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
