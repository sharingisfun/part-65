However, after the death of his father's life changed. Yes, even when one of the teachers allow themselves to Kayla tactless joke about his father, Cale responds to it so that it will be in court. His sentence to house arrest, he should wear a bracelet on his leg, which signals the police if he moves away from home more than thirty meters. Now he's losing his mind in his own house while his mother tries to make ends meet, working almost around the clock. The windows of his house became his world.
