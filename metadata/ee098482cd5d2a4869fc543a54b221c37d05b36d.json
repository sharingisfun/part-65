Programming With Data describes a new and greatly extended version of S, written by the chief designer of the language itself. It is a guide to the complete programming process, starting from simple, interactive use, and continuing through ambitious software projects. The focus is on the needs of the programmer/user, with the aim of turning ideas into software, quickly and faithfully. The new version of S provides a powerful class/method structure, new techniques to deal with large objects, extended interfaces to other languages and files, object-based documentation compatible with HTML, and powerful new interactive programming techniques. This version of S underlies the S-Plus system, versions 5.0 and higher.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee098482cd5d2a4869fc543a54b221c37d05b36d","amp;dn":"Programming+with+Data%3A+A+Guide+to+the+S+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee098482cd5d2a4869fc543a54b221c37d05b36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,9,132,130,205,93,42,72,105,252,84,58,84,178,33,195,125,5,179,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
