Plant Plants - Dandelion\n\t\t\n\n\n\nProduced by Simian Mobile Disco DJ Jas Shaw, this four track EP is the middle-ground situated precisely between 2007 and 2011, which due to the fanciful and tumultuous nature of the musical beast, sounds literally nothing like 2009. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also more than a little bit good. Opening song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hands that SleepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ starts with a curious, cleverly underdeveloped Foals riff embellishing Rounds-era Four Tet drum flushes, before a glorious wash of thick, streaming synth cascades from one ear to the other, ostensibly leaving the listener smiling and soaking in Awesome while that insistently simple riff tries on a host of flattering new clothes. Judging by the Bambi Mix mixtape uploaded by the duo to Soundcloud earlier this year, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d perhaps fit nicely into a mould of smooth 2011 soundsmiths ranging from How to Dress Well to The Weeknd to D/R/U/G/S, and a whole clutch of other artists I still canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bring myself to listen to because their names sound like something idly dreamt up by The Mighty Boosh. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s No OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, too, rides the waves of leisurely opulence; a skew-whiff acoustic-guitar-and-synth love song accentuated by awkward stabs of sonic sunlight, which would probably go down equally as well on the right kinda dancefloor as it does in the sweaty musical bordello of my mind, which is to say, very well indeed. - Drowned In Sound \n\n\nSeed &amp; Enjoy!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17612c64aea59e8ac5d60ae9c9a9a3ecbfd68ae5","amp;dn":"Plant+Plants+-+Plants+Plants+EP+%5B2011%5D+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17612c64aea59e8ac5d60ae9c9a9a3ecbfd68ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,97,44,100,174,165,158,138,197,214,10,233,201,169,163,236,191,214,138,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
