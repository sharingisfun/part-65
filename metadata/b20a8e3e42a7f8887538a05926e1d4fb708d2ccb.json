Iris challenges her, saying that she \n\nis training to be a Dragon Master. Langley sends out her Beartic, with Iris afraid, but sending \n\nout Axew to fight it. Axew is easily beaten, and Iris sends out Excadrill next, but he will not \n\nobey her orders. Georgia taunts her before she leaves. As Iris tries to comfort Excadrill, he \n\ncurls up into inactive mode once more. Iris tells Ash and Cilan that like long ago, this time, \n\nExcadrill was defeated by the move Rock Smash. She tells Ash and Cilan how she captured Excadrill \n\nwhen she first found him as a Drilbur bothering other PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon in the forest around her home town \n\nmany years ago. After she saved him after he nearly fell off a cliff, Drilbur became Iris's \n\npartner and trained under her, eventually evolving into an Excadrill and winning a tournament in \n\nher home. Drayden, a Dragon Master, tells Iris that he is impressed. She challenges him to a \n\nbattle, and says it will be their 100th victory, and she wants it to be against a Dragon Master. \n\nHe accepts her challenge, but when Excadrill fights Shaga's Haxorus, none of its moves appear \n\neffective, and he loses the match. Upset, Excadrill shut itself off from Iris and has not listened \n\nto her. Cilan says that it is not disappointment that is causing Excadrill's behavior but anger at \n\nIris for forcing it to fight a match that he knew that he would lose. That night, Iris apologizes \n\nto Excadrill, saying that she did not try to understand his feelings. Excadrill listens in \n\nsurprise, remembering how Iris never gave up trying to beat him, and her words of encouragement. \n\nHe moves out of its inactive mode, but Iris is already asleep. Excadrill goes into the woods to \n\npractice its Focus Blast move, until Iris wakes up and sees it, deciding to help him master the \n\nmove. The next day, Georgia comes across the group again after she has eaten their breakfast, and \n\nIris challenges her to a match, again. With Excadrill's trust once again formed with Iris, and his \n\nnewly learned Focus Blast, he is now an even match for Georgia's Beartic, but both defeat each \n\nother at the same time, resulting in a tie. Georgia, although upset, still claims she is a Dragon \n\nBuster. she tells Iris to meet her again one day in battle, and Cilan to prepare a better meal for \n\nher. Iris comforts Excadrill in the draw, saying it was a great battle. Excadrill hugs her, and \n\nshe hugs back, saying that she loves Excadrill. In the end, Excadrill and Iris are once again good \n\nfriends. \nComplete name                    : Pokemon Black and White -36- Iris and Excadrill Against the \n\nDragon Buster! 720p salman sk.m4v\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 100 MiB\nDuration                         : 21mn 22s\nOverall bit rate                 : 657 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2011-09-18 12:23:25\nTagged date                      : UTC 2011-09-18 12:42:02\nlanguage\t\t\t : English\n\nvideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d39eb2babd939fe0fde2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 4 frames\nFormat settings, GOP             : M=1, N=2\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 21mn 22s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 490 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate               : 29.412 fps\nMaximum frame rate               : 30.303 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.018\nStream size                      : 74.9 MiB (75%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 112\n\naudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nFormat settings, SBR             : No\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 21mn 21s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 190 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 24.4 MiB (24%)\nLanguage                         : English\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2011-09-18 12:23:25\nTagged date                      : UTC 2011-09-18 12:42:02\nAudio language\t\t\t : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20a8e3e42a7f8887538a05926e1d4fb708d2ccb","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Black+and+White+-36-+Iris+and+Excadrill+Against+the+Drag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20a8e3e42a7f8887538a05926e1d4fb708d2ccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,10,142,62,66,167,248,136,117,56,160,89,38,225,212,251,112,141,44,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
