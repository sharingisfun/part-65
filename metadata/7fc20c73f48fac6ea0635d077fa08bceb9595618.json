After winning the final fight of the opening ceremony, Gannicus receives his freedom and departs the ludus, but not before entrusting its future to Crixus.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe mini-series features the bloody history of the House of Batiatus and the city of Capua before the arrival of Spartacus. Quintus Lentulus Batiatus becomes a lanista (manager) when he takes over his father's ludus of gladiators. He has ambitions of stepping out of his father's shadow by seeking recognition for his own name and achieving greatness for his house. By his side stands his beautiful wife Lucretia who will help her husband achieve his goal no matter what the cost. Batiatus puts all his fortunes on the man who will gain him fame and glory, his best gladiator, the Celt, Gannicus; a skilled warrior who wields his swords in the arena as if it were his last day alive. However, there are those who oppose Batiatus and his future champion(s) of Capua, plotting against him only to fail. Purchased as an undisciplined and disheveled recruit in the first episode, the Gaul Crixus endures mockery and threats of death to become the greatest gladiator in the house after Gannicus. As Batiatus fends off repeated attempts by his professional rival Tullius to obtain Gannicus, his relationships with his father Titus and friend Solonius begin to suffer the strain of Quintus' relentless ambition. Former champion gladiator Oenomaus reluctantly retires from combat to become Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan become fierce enemies as Ashur tries to prove himself worthy of being a gladiator. Veteran gladiators Barca and Gannicus accept the rising star of Crixus but fear that their own careers will suffer, as the machinations of Batiatus and Lucretia to court Capua's elite end in tragedy for several members of the household. Against all of this, the city's splendid new arena nears completion and with it the opening games that will make men into gods.\n\n\nCAST:\n\nMain cast\n\nJohn Hannah as Quintus Lentulus Batiatus\nLucy Lawless as Lucretia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Batiatus' wife.\nDustin Clare as Gannicus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ champion gladiator of the Batiatus' ludus.\nPeter Mensah as Oenomaus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a gladiator who later becomes the Batiatus' doctore (gladiator trainer).\nJaime Murray as Gaia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a social climber and Lucretia's friend.\nMarisa Ramirez as Melitta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lucretia's personal slave and the wife of Oenomaus.\nJeffrey Thomas as Titus Lentulus Batiatus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Quintus Batiatus' father and owner of the family's ludus.\nStephen Lovatt as Tullius ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Batiatus' business rival.\nManu Bennett as Crixus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a trainee gladiator.\nNick Tarabay as Ashur ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a trainee gladiator.\nCraig Walsh Wrightson as Marcus Decius Solonius ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Batiatus' friend.\nAntonio Te Maioha as Barca ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a gladiator.\nGareth Williams as Vettius, Tullius' young henchman and owner of a rival ludus.\nLesley-Ann Brandt as Naevia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a slave girl.\n\nSupporting cast\n\nJessica Grace Smith as Diona ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a slave girl.\nTemuera Morrison as Doctore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Oenomaus' predecessor as the Batiatus' gladiator trainer.\nJosef Brown as Auctus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a gladiator.\nShane Rangi as Dagan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a trainee gladiator.\n\n\nGenre: Historical drama\nMini-series\n\nCreator Steven S.
