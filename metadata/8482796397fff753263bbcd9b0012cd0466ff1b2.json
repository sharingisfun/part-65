Why?\n\nOn his journey through the ages, Professor Cox explores the role that international competition played in getting man to the Moon and asks if, with America no longer the world's only superpower, we are at the dawn of a bright new space age.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00llgs8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00llgs8&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1404 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 96 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 633 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: PDTV\n\nSRT available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8482796397fff753263bbcd9b0012cd0466ff1b2","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Horizon+Guide+Moon+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8482796397fff753263bbcd9b0012cd0466ff1b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,130,121,99,151,255,247,83,38,59,188,217,176,1,44,208,70,111,241,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
