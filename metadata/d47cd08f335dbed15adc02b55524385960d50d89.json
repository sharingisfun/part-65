This song has quickly become a heavy rotation favorite for the band, and their version is really coming into its own.  Sandwiched in between the two was a red-hot version of Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad, with Warren and Derek trading licks in a guitar lover's dream!\n\nBruce Katz really did add a lot, especially to Jessica and Desdemona, each worthy of being the centerpiece jam of a show.  Other second set highlights include Brother Gregory's stunning vocals on Desdemona plus the Muddy Waters tune &quot;I Can't Be Satisfied,&quot; a tune from his upcoming solo album that has quickly found a home in ABB setlists. \n\nAdd in a magnificent Les Brers and a stirring Southbound encore and you've got another great show in Boston!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc One\n\n1.
