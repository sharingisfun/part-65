The name referred to the band being the fifth that Quinn has played in. The band's first album North Pole was self-released on Quinn's Bellbeat Music label. They signed with Re-Action Recordings for the second album Go! . Allmusic's Matt Collar described the album as &quot;A sparkling, sun-drenched blast of melodic guitar pop&quot; and said it was &quot;a superb album equal to its predecessor in every way -- and perhaps even a little better.&quot;\nThe third album, High Five, was recorded at Leeders Farm in Norwich and was produced by Nick Brine, who had previously worked with Oasis and Bruce Springsteen, among others. High Five was released in 2008 on the Neon Tetra label. One critic compared the sound on High Five to The Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.\nOn November 1, 2010 Quinn released The Primary 5 - Revive Demos &amp; Rarities - 2001-2008 and announced that the band was officially defunct.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf39cc50ec81f5cd586fb280b701b55103d29399","amp;dn":"The+Primary+5+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf39cc50ec81f5cd586fb280b701b55103d29399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,57,204,80,236,129,245,205,88,111,178,128,183,1,181,81,3,210,147,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
