And it is as sensational and striking as its title! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeath magic doomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ breaks the chains of genre restrictions and serves the listener an album of monumental, breathtaking (Doom) Metal formed to perfection.\n\nMany listeners might be unaware that on CANDLEMASS` groundbreaking debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEpicus Doomicus MetallicusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (which gave a name to a whole subgenera) the vocal duties were not covered by Messiah, but by a certain Johan Langquist. Messiah joined Black Sabbath enthusiast Leif Edling and the rest of the crew in time for their second effort, the immortal and epic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNightfallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The density of all-time favourites such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDark Are The Veils Of DeathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBewitchedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Well Of SoulsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the 1987 album was, and still remains, breathtaking. After the release of 1989`s concept album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTales Of CreationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Messiah left the band for the first time. The two ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcomebackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDactylis GlomerataÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrom The 13th SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were recorded with different vocalists and saw the band experimenting with new moods and styles. The reunion with Messiah, who rejoined the band in 2002 for a legendary tour and more memorable shows, didn`t last long: shock and dismay hit the scene once again in 2004 as the next split occurred. Marcolin returned for the self-titled, massive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCandlemassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album which marked the band`s debut with Nuclear Blast. This opus embraced both a heavy, modern sound and the timeless CANDLEMASS trademarks that has won legions of fans since the bands early days in the mid eighties. After the monk had left for good during the recording sessions for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKing Of The Grey IslandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Robert Lowe (SOLITUDE AETURNUS) picked up the microphone in 2007 and delivered a hauntingly great job on this sombre concept album. The CANDLEMASS fans gave Robert a warm welcome on their following European tour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just listen to the live cuts on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLucifer risingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ EP (2008)!\n\nNow the Swedish/Texan fivepiece has returned with an album that deserves the title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclassicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ right from the start ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ because ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeath Magic DoomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has it all! Uptempo Metal madness (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢If I ever dieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢), grinding Doom (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Hammer of DoomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, which the record was initially supposed to be called) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ most of all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ those immortal hymns with achingly addictive and beautiful melody lines (just check out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Dead angelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The bleeding baronessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢)! Recorded once more at the famous Swedish Polar Studios, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeath Magic DoomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ captures CANDLEMASS at their personal best: immortal songwriting, incredible guitar solos and Robert`s brilliant vocals...
