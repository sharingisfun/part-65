Alan (Christoph Waltz) and Nancy (Kate Winslet) are the parents of Zachary, a young schoolboy whose recent fight with classmate Ethan resulted in two of Ethan's teeth being broken. Convinced that they can find an amiable solution to the problem rather than dragging lawyers into the picture, Ethan's parents Penelope (Jodie Foster) and Michael (John C. Reilly) invite Alan and Nancy to their home to discuss the matter in a comfortable setting. At first the conversation is cordial, with both sets of parents stating their own perspectives over coffee and dessert. But once the booze starts to flow and the guards come down, things begin to turn combative. As the evening wears on, both sets of parents are slinging venomous insults and engaging in underhanded behavior that makes their kids' tooth-chipping tussle look like child's play.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 20 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 640\n\nFrame Height: 272\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 128kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:204c4904479dbc4c2394aa19e0de76d0b89f71f3","amp;dn":"Carnage%282011%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"204c4904479dbc4c2394aa19e0de76d0b89f71f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,76,73,4,71,157,188,76,35,148,170,25,224,222,118,208,184,159,113,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
