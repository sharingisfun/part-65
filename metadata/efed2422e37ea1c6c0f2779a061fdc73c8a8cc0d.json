Important Happening (Molin/Gross) 08:47\n\nBand:\n- Gross, Andreas / Guitar, bass, vocals\n- Ludwig, Lutz / Drums\n- Molin, Thomas / keyboards, vocals\n\n\nFor the first time on CD: The radio session of classical rock influenced great German krautrockers Amos Key. Amos Key owed great debts to Bach, Beethoven and Schumann, adding a heavy krautrock twist to a music closely resembling the Nice or Egg, full of angst and weird psychedelic and space-rock touches (Freeman Brothers: In A Crack In The Cosmic Egg). Amos Key lived in Munich and consisted of great organ-player Thomas Molin, congenial bass-player Andreas Gross and superb drummer Lutz Ludwig. This fairly competent outfit recorded the radio sessions before they released their famous and very rare album &quot;First Key&quot; in 1973 on label &quot;Spiegelei&quot;. Sadly bandleader and organ-player Thomas Molin passed away in the 90ies but bass-player Andreas Gross tells the band story in a very vivid and funny way. 24 pages booklet contains also a lot of unseen photos. Sound is perfect; remastered from the original tape. Don't miss this superb item.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efed2422e37ea1c6c0f2779a061fdc73c8a8cc0d","amp;dn":"Amos+Key+-+Keynotes+%281973%2F2010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efed2422e37ea1c6c0f2779a061fdc73c8a8cc0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,237,36,34,227,126,161,198,192,242,119,154,6,31,220,115,200,168,204,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
