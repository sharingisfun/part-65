When Anna Marchant (Milla Jovovich) was attacked by the killer known as Tearjerk Jack, a blow to the head left her stricken with prosopagnosia. Commonly known as face-blindness, it's a psychological affliction that renders even one's closest relatives unrecognizable. Now, with only her sense of hearing to go on as the hunt for Tearjerk Jack intensifies, Anna joins Detective Kerrest (Julian McMahon) in attempting to track down the elusive madman before he strikes again. Meanwhile, Tearjerk Jack has no problem recognizing Anna, and he's determined to silence her before she can turn him in to the police.\n\nRipped with Autogk\n\nLength: 1 Hour 42 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 672\n\nFrame Height: 288\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 128kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c29262952513fc503f2aef81e9771335bebfe5","amp;dn":"Faces+in+the+Crowd%282011%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c29262952513fc503f2aef81e9771335bebfe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,194,146,98,149,37,19,252,80,63,42,239,129,233,119,19,53,190,191,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
