After 2 years on the road, Paper Mache had completed over 450 shows supporting their debut record &quot;Easier to Lose&quot;. A DIY band comprised of members from all over the globe, Paper Mache began as an idea formed in the mind of frontman Chelsea Seth Woodward. After the release of &quot;Easier to Lose&quot; the band built a rapid, cult-like following of fans. The band is quick to deny this however, stating that the people they have encountered on the road are more like friends and family, than fans\n\nThese guys will rock your music world. I heard about them from a friend and listened to their album 7 times in a day! Their band's story is pretty depressing but still hopefully. Enjoy, and I hope to post more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c24c2145571a1d461364f36819afd579992f87","amp;dn":"Paper+Mache-+Lightning+Bug","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c24c2145571a1d461364f36819afd579992f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,194,76,33,69,87,26,29,70,19,100,243,104,25,175,213,121,153,47,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
