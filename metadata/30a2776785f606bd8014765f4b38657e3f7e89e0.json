While I'm not deaf, I like to watch movies at night when the family is asleep. The subtitles allow me to do that by watching the film without sound. The only so-called English subtitles I could find were a version that was created from the Portugese soundtrack of the film. The results were hideous and couldn't be used to the point you didn't what they were saying. &quot;Master&quot; came out as &quot;My love&quot; for some reason. So I downloaded a program called Subrip and opened up the file and begin changing what they had to the what was really being said in English. I hope you enjoy it and feel free to post the file on any subtitle site.
