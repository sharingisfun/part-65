Released in 1988 on Wax Trax! records (Wax 056), virtually simultaneous with another EP, Some Have to Dance, Some Have to Kill (Wax 055). \nTheir sound was initially an amalgam of heavy dance rhythms, horror film sampling, and quasi-Satanic imagery. Their early recordings were extremely popular in industrial dance clubs. A music video was released for the song, &quot;...And This is What the Devil Does!&quot;, and appears on The Kult Kollection DVD. \n\nIn 2004, the album was remastered and reissued with three bonus tracks featuring two live tracks recorded on October 28, 1988 at The Riviera, Chicago.\n\nCD bought brand new, immediately ripped with dbpoweramp Secure Rip and encoded to FLAC @ Level 5 compression. Nfo file with AccurateRip info included. \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Heresy&quot;  \t4:01\n2.\t&quot;X-Communication&quot;  \t5:10\n3.\t&quot;Do You Fear (For Your Child?)&quot;  \t5:34\n4.\t&quot;Easy Girl&quot;  \t4:11\n5.\t&quot;Universal Blackness&quot;  \t7:08\n6.\t&quot;...And This is What the Devil Does!&quot;  \t5:56\n7.\t&quot;These Remains&quot;  \t5:20\n8.\t&quot;On This Rack&quot;  \t4:38\n9.\t&quot;Gateway to Hell&quot;  \t4:26\n10.\t&quot;Scene One, Seen 'Em All&quot;  \t1:52\n11.\t&quot;Nervous Xians&quot; (Live)\t4:15\n12.\t&quot;X-Communication&quot; (Live)\t4:56\n13.\t&quot;Back From Beyond&quot;  \t3:47\n\nTotal length: 61:14\n\n\nEnjoy, seed, and support the artist!!\n\nCheck out my other torrents for more offbeat and classic music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9453521a4cb7cbe60cb3d9534b95f18233f21bc","amp;dn":"Thrill+Kill+Kult+-+I+See+Good+Spirits+and+I+See+Bad+Spirits+Reis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9453521a4cb7cbe60cb3d9534b95f18233f21bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,69,53,33,164,203,124,190,96,203,61,149,52,185,95,24,35,63,33,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
