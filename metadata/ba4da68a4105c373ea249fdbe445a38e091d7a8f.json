With need\n  of further natural resources and living space, the human race rapidly\n  expands. Unprepared for the scale of development, the Federation, overseer\n  for the process of colonizing the universe, limit the selling of \n  'terra-forming' permits. Outraged by the decision, powerful mega\n  corporations begin holding an authoritarian rule on their very own &quot;private&quot;\n  planets. The full autonomy of these new worlds soon creates a safe haven\n  for criminal activity and bringing down the Federation is their number one\n  priority. \n\n  For a little more than 12 months the Federation's special division has led\n  an investigation into the ever more frequent case of government officers\n  being confronted by criminals, commonly found under the influence of an as\n  yet unknown stimulant. Based of synthetic enzymes, the substance causes the\n  fearless, aggressive, trigger-happy and pain resistant hitmen to wreak \n  havoc, and the problem is now spreading. \n\n  Created with the purpose of ridding the planetary system of global hazards\n  and crisis situations endangering the Federation's stability, the elite\n  strike unit Chrome: SpecForce has finally caught a break in the \n  investigation. \n\n  Armed with the latest military technology in combat, designed with Special\n  Forces in mind, the SpecForce field agents equip themselves with SPA4\n  Power Armour, the main element of a SpecForce field agent's operational\n  equipment and vital to mission success. Be it assassination, espionage,\n  infiltration or sabotage, the armours systems enhance the efficiency of \n  tactical operations conducted in enemy territory. \n\n  Dispatched to the planetary system of Estrella to collect evidence, it \n  quickly becomes clear that a seemingly simple task leads to an intrigue\n  on a much grander scale...\n\n\n  Extract the RAR File &amp; read the README file, enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba4da68a4105c373ea249fdbe445a38e091d7a8f","amp;dn":"Chrome%3A+SpecForce+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba4da68a4105c373ea249fdbe445a38e091d7a8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,77,166,138,65,5,195,115,234,36,159,219,228,69,163,142,9,29,122,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
