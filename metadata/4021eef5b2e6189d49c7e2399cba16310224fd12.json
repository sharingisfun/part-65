Her relationship with her mother Pamela Matters (Aunjanue Ellis- RAY, MEN OF HONER), is far from stable and depicts the struggle between a young mother and daughter who both come of ageÃ¢â‚¬Â¦together. Sharp and candid dialogue blur the roles of parent and child, revealing a family secret magnified by pain and years of regret. MoneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daily routine; a three-bus commute to the Catholic school she attends, far from her dilapidated neighborhood, to another world where she feels just as uncomfortable. When she befriends a neighborhood girl who seems to understand her, their friendship develops in ways that push boundaries.\n\nnull\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB Rating: 5.1/10 from 13 users\nDirected by: Ryan Richmond\nStarring: Aunjanue Ellis, Terri Abney and James Whalen\n\nRelease Name: Money.Matters.2011.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-PTpOWeR\nSize: 1.35 GB\nVideo: Xvid : 624 x 352 , 2165 kb/s\nAudio: English AC3 192 kb/s\nRuntime: 01:29:10\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4021eef5b2e6189d49c7e2399cba16310224fd12","amp;dn":"Money.Matters.2011.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-PTpOWeR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4021eef5b2e6189d49c7e2399cba16310224fd12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,33,238,245,178,230,24,157,73,199,226,57,156,186,22,49,2,36,253,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
