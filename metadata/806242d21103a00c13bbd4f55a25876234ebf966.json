Set in      \n         Atlanta during the 2008 Presidential Election    \n         season, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do is the         \n         touching story of what happens when two people   \n         feel they have nothing more to give to a         \n         relationship. A funny and intimate look at how   \n         people fall in love and what it takes to stay    \n         there, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do touches on      \n         the reality of the outside forces that can       \n         make or break a relationship. They say the       \n         truth will set you free, but when Shonda and     \n         Vince are armed with the truth, will they use    \n         it to set themselves free for once and for       \n         all?                                             \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                       \n                               \n                   \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n     ASPECT &amp; STANDARD  AUDiO \n                                                                     \n         [ ] Fullscreen  4:3        [*] English                        \n         [*] Widescreen 16:9        [ ] Dutch      [ ] DTS 6.1         \n          [23.976] Framerate         [ ] French     [ ] DS 5.1           \n         [624x352 ] Resolution      [ ] German     [*] DS 2.0          \n                                    [ ] Spanish    [ ] DS 2.0 MONO     \n                                    [ ] Other                          \n                                                                       \n                                    [ac3@192kbps       ]               \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n      SUBTiTLES  \n                                                                     \n       [ ] English     [ ] Swedish     [ ] Spanish     [ ] Dutch       \n       [ ] Danish      [ ] German      [ ] Polish      [ ] Italian     \n       [ ] Arabic      [ ] Bulgarian   [ ] Czech       [ ] Greek       \n        [ ] Hindi       [ ] Hungarian   [ ] Croatic     [ ] Romenian     \n       [ ] Slovenia    [ ] Turkish     [ ] Icelandic   [ ] Finnish     \n       [ ] Norwegian   [ ] French      [ ] Hebrew      [ ] Other       \n                                                       [*] None        \n                                                                       \n     ViDEO  MENU  DVD-EXTRAS \n                                                                     \n        [ ] Untouched       [ ] Untouched      [ ] Untouched           \n        [*] Re-encoded      [*] Stripped       [*] Stripped            \n        [2] Passes                             [ ] Partial Stripped    \n        [1608] Bitrate                         [ ] Re-encoded          \n                                               [0] Passes              \n                                                                     \n      Rippers Notes  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n       Note: HQ sites needed: see contact info plz!                      \n                                                                       \n                                               \n                                               \n                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n         Greetz to everyone helping out the BD WMV and DVDR scene!     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Special greetz to: TARGET INSECTS VOMIT SADPANDA SPiCE MHD MaxHD  \n                       Start2 QwiiF XorCist WiiLP NTX XPRESS THUGLiNE  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                     R.I.P.
