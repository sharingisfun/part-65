It used to be that corporations were, by definition, short-lived and finite in agenda. If a town needed a bridge built, a corporation was set up to finance and complete the project; when the bridge was an accomplished fact, the corporation ceased to be. Then came the 19th-century robber barons, and the courts were prevailed upon to define corporations not as get-the-job-done mechanisms but as persons under the 14th Amendment with full civil rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (i.e., power and profit)--ad infinitum. This movie maps the new reality. This is our world--welcome to it.\n\nFormat: NTSC\nDVD Size: 7.74 + 7.80 GB -- Exact Untouched Copy\nRuntime (main feature): 145 minutes\nType: Color\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1\nSound (main feature): English DD2.0\nSubtitles: optional English | Spanish | French\n\nSet Features\n----------------\ndisc one:\n# Two filmmaker audio commentaries.\n# Janeane Garofolo interviews writer Joel Bakan on Air AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Majority Report\n# Video interviews with the filmmakers from radio, TV and theaters, including segments from CNN Financial, WNYC, WBAI, and Air America\n# Trailers for The Corporation and Manufacturing Consent\n# Eight deleted scenes\n# Grassroots marketing presentation\n# English descriptive audio for the visually impaired\n\ndisc two:\n# 165 never-before-seen clips and updates are sorted by person and by subject.
