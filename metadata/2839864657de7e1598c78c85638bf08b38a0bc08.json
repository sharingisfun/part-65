The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but &quot;won't take 'no' for an answer.&quot; The player races off Ã¢â‚¬â€ despite Samantha's warnings Ã¢â‚¬â€ only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.\n\nFast forward to the present day, where we see the player arriving in Bayview via airplane, with a note from Samantha referring him to her friend Rachel (Voiced over by Brooke Burke), who will set the player up there. He also has the keys to Rachel's Nissan 350Z, which is waiting for him outside the airport. The player then has the option to complete a few races in the car before inevitably returning it to the car lot, where Rachel will give him an earful for being late before allowing him to choose his first car. This one is free, as it was paid for by the player's insurance from his totaled Skyline.\n\nIt is then that the player embarks on a quest to become the top racer in Bayview and eventually take down the man who sabotaged his ride in the flashback, who turns out to be Caleb. After winning many races, the player runs into Caleb's street racing crew, The Wraiths. The crew has the same vinyl, paint, and rim set. The player challenges them to a series of URL (Underground Racing League) races and eventually gets Caleb's second in command, Nikki, to join his side. Rachel tells the player that Caleb has been manipulating the sponsorship deals throughout Bayview towards him. After the player beats The Wraiths, an infuriated Caleb challenges the player to one final race in his custom Pontiac GTO.\n\n\nMINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n===========================\nWindows 98, 98 Second Edition, ME, 2000 Professional, XP Professional, \nor XP Home operating system\nIntel Pentium III (or equivalent) CPU running at 933MHz or higher\n32MB DirectX 9.0c compatible video card (Geforce2 or higher) using a \nsupported chipset (see below)\n256 MB RAM\nDirectX compatible sound card\n2 GB of HD space\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2839864657de7e1598c78c85638bf08b38a0bc08","amp;dn":"Need+For+Speed+Underground+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2839864657de7e1598c78c85638bf08b38a0bc08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,57,134,70,87,222,126,21,152,199,140,133,99,139,240,139,56,160,188,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
