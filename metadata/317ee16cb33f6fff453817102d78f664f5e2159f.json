Explosions and flumes of smoke. Trees blown back with the blasts. Under Defeat pushed to the limits of the Dreamcast's graphics quality, presenting the battlefield in full 3D with realistic detail. Though the gameplay stays true to the simplicity of a traditional 2D-shooter, Under Defeat's expressionism allows gamers to indulge in the pleasure of blowing digital things up.\nAll new Remix Mode\nUnder Defeat HD is not just a port of the original title. In addition to the arcade version, the all new Remix Mode (temporary name) makes full use of 16:9 televisions. More details to come, so stay tuned.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:317ee16cb33f6fff453817102d78f664f5e2159f","amp;dn":"Under+Defeat+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"317ee16cb33f6fff453817102d78f664f5e2159f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,126,225,108,179,63,111,255,69,56,23,16,45,120,246,100,245,226,21,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
