Angela Dodson who needs his help to prove that her twin sister Isabel's death was not a suicide. The dead woman was a devout Catholic and Angela refuses to accept that she would have taken her own life. She's asked Constantine for help because he has a reputation for dealing with the mystical. In fact, he is a demon hunter whose sole purpose on Earth is to send demons back to the nether regions. John himself has been to Hell - as a young man he too committed suicide and now knows that he is destined to return there on his death - but hopes that his good deeds may somehow find him a place in Heaven. As he looks into Isobel's death, he realizes that demons are trying to break through to the human world and his battles lead him into a direct conflict with Satan.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071f864c51bbbdabf6aeb7873f5bbee6ac26c239","amp;dn":"Constantine+%282005%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071f864c51bbbdabf6aeb7873f5bbee6ac26c239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,31,134,76,81,187,189,171,246,174,183,135,63,91,190,230,172,38,194,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
