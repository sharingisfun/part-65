Thunder Road\n2. Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\n3. Night\n4. Backstreets\n5. Born To Run\n6. She's The One\n7. Meeting Across The River\n8. Jungleland\n\n\nBruce Springsteen has said that when he set out to record this album, he was going to make &quot;the greatest rock and roll record ever.&quot; Well, maybe he came up short, but if so, only by a hair. &quot;Born To Run&quot; is nearly flawless from beginning to end; each song tells its own distinct story, yet all are wonderfully woven around the album's central theme, which is also the title of the record.\nOver a quarter century after the release of &quot;Born To Run,&quot; we may have come to take this album for granted, forgetting the incredible rush it gave us the first thousand times we heard it. Make no mistake - this is one of the best rock albums ever recorded. From the lyrics to the melodies to the production, The Boss held nothing back. This recording provides evidence that Springsteen works as hard in the studio as he does on stage. Each track is now, after all these years, immediately recognizable - the opening harmonica strains of &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; the symphonic piano introduction to &quot;Jungleland,&quot; the organ that kicks off &quot;Backstreets,&quot; and, of course, the explosion of sound that is the title track. \nI can't imagine anyone not owning this recording. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 79\nArtist: Bruce Springsteen\nAlbum: Born To Run\nYear: 1975\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3433d6fffb08452354753b4dd2bbce341fa3f0","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Born+To+Run+%5BFLAC-1975%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3433d6fffb08452354753b4dd2bbce341fa3f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,52,51,214,255,251,8,69,35,84,117,59,77,210,187,206,52,31,163,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
