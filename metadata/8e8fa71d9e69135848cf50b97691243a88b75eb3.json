While Jack burns up, Jennifer notices that her own skin isn't reacting to the sun. When news of Jack's &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot; reaches the newspapers, reporter Sean Flynt [Glen Meadows] becomes interested. So does vampire Victor Chamberlain [Ty Winston]. But Jennifer is more interested in finding out why she didn't react to the sun, so she reads up on vampires in the local bookstore. She learns that she is a &quot;pure&quot; vampire (a mortal who was &quot;pure&quot; at the time of turning can become a &quot;pure&quot; vampire with superpowers and the ability to become mortal again if she falls in love with a mortal who also falls in love with her) and that her powers will be at their greatest during the next solar eclipse which, coincidentally, happens in four days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e8fa71d9e69135848cf50b97691243a88b75eb3","amp;dn":"Embrace+The+Darkness+3+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e8fa71d9e69135848cf50b97691243a88b75eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,143,167,29,158,105,19,88,72,207,80,185,118,145,36,58,136,183,94,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
