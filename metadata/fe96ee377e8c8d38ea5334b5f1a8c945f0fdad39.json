Providing mathematical foundations as well as physical applications, this is the first systematic explanation of canonical methods in gravity.\n\nThe book discusses the mathematical and geometrical notions underlying canonical tools, highlighting their applications in all aspects of gravitational research from advanced mathematical foundations to modern applications in cosmology and black hole physics. The main canonical formulations, including the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism and Ashtekar variables, are derived and discussed.\n\nIdeal for both graduate students and researchers, this book provides a link between standard introductions to general relativity and advanced expositions of black hole physics, theoretical cosmology or quantum gravity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe96ee377e8c8d38ea5334b5f1a8c945f0fdad39","amp;dn":"Canonical+Gravity+%26+Applications+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe96ee377e8c8d38ea5334b5f1a8c945f0fdad39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,150,238,55,126,140,141,56,234,83,52,181,241,168,201,69,240,253,173,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
