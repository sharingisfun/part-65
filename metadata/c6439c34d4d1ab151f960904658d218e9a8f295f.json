He promises to learn about all religions, so studies Veda, Koran, &amp; Bible. he returns home but does not compromise with his family's conservative outlook, so leaves home again.

He starts his own business, writes the explanation of Veda &amp; becomes the first man of the Bengali prose. Sets up a modern school where English language becomes an essential part of syllabus, because he knows, English will be the most connective language of future world. His wife, Uma, reminds him about the Satidaha Pratha, he starts his battle against this custom. All his activites create a storm in conservative Hindu society &amp; large part of the society became his enemy. His lonely battle ends when the ' Sati ' bill passed &amp; the government stops the custom by law. Badshah of Delhi give him the title ' Raja ' &amp; sends him to England as ambassador of Delhi.
