What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 4- Tuesday - Sake head chef Shaun Presland takes on the winner of Sunday's Invention Test in a Raw Food Immunity Challenge. With no cooking, no heat and no gas bench tops they need to be super creative. \n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3753dc27148e1c5783cecf07a7a7577a9f382ce7","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E21.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3753dc27148e1c5783cecf07a7a7577a9f382ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,83,220,39,20,142,28,87,131,206,207,7,167,167,87,122,159,56,44,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
