Along with newly-arrived star surgeon, Joel Goran (Daniel Gillies, THE VAMPIRE DIARIES), Alex races to save Harris life. As the action unfolds, comatose Dr. Harris wanders the halls of Hope-Zee in spirit form, not sure if hes a ghost or a figment of his own imagination. Reid, along with her fellow doctors, press on to save his life and those of their other patients, as they deal with the complicated and courageous decisions that are made in their daily struggle to keep hope alive.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Hope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Hope&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSaving.Hope.S01E01.720p.WEB.DL.DD5.1.H.264.KiNGS.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      Duration : 43mn 30s\n      Overall bit rate : 4 480 Kbps\n  \n   Video #1\n      Format settings, ReFrames : 2 frames\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Duration : 43mn 30s\n      Bit rate : 4 006 Kbps\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 720 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n   \n   Audio #2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Codec ID : A_AC3\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 384 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb6ba620f7c53a379233ba32636b8916079eabbc","amp;dn":"Saving.Hope.S01E01.720p.WEB.DL.DD5.1.H.264.KiNGS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb6ba620f7c53a379233ba32636b8916079eabbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,107,166,32,247,197,58,55,146,51,186,50,99,107,137,22,7,158,171,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
