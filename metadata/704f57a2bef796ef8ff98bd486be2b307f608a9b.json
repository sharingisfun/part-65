Lots of playing from center stage, a few songs on guitar ect. The recording solid, there is some audience noise as was at the Comerica, a little different than last night though, instead of idiots complaining about their seats, you just get a few people overly excited for the show in between songs, far more appropriate in my opinion.\n\nSorry, no artwork this time, didn't have my source for pics this go around.\n\nOnce again Bobcats, it's all good to convert these to mp3's and trade them for free, just please, no &quot;re-mastering&quot; edited from lossy mp3's.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704f57a2bef796ef8ff98bd486be2b307f608a9b","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+AVA+Amphitheatre+Tucson%2C+AZ%2C+USA+2011-07-19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704f57a2bef796ef8ff98bd486be2b307f608a9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,79,87,162,190,247,150,239,143,249,139,212,134,190,43,48,127,96,138,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
