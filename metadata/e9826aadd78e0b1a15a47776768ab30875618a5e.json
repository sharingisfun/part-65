He spent years skipping through cyberspace, always three steps ahead and labeled unstoppable. But for Kevin, hacking wasn't just about technological feats-it was an old fashioned confidence game that required guile and deception to trick the unwitting out of valuable information. Driven by a powerful urge to accomplish the impossible, Mitnick bypassed security systems and blazed into major organizations including Motorola, Sun Microsystems, and Pacific Bell.\nBut as the FBI's net began to tighten, Kevin went on the run, engaging in an increasingly sophisticated cat and mouse game that led through false identities, a host of cities, plenty of close shaves, and an ultimate showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down.\nGhost in the Wires is a thrilling true story of intrigue, suspense, and unbelievable escape, and a portrait of a visionary whose creativity, skills, and persistence forced the authorities to rethink the way they pursued him, inspiring ripples that brought permanent changes in the way people and companies protect their most sensitive information.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead By Ray Porter.\n\n----------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n----------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9826aadd78e0b1a15a47776768ab30875618a5e","amp;dn":"Ghost+in+the+Wires+-+Kevin+Mitnick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9826aadd78e0b1a15a47776768ab30875618a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,130,106,173,215,142,11,26,21,164,119,118,118,138,179,8,117,97,138,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
