What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 8 - Tuesday - Rum and raisin is a classic combination, but will it be a perfect match for our contestant in the Immunity Challenge? Chef Daniel Wilson also joins the kitchen. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d0b9b92a3b9809fe5639adfe7ce93656659256","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E45.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d0b9b92a3b9809fe5639adfe7ce93656659256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,208,185,185,42,59,152,9,254,86,57,173,254,124,233,54,86,101,146,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
