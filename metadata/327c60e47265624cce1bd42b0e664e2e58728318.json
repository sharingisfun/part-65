For the most grueling Truck Stop challenge yet, the teams have four hours to retrieve a 100 lb. hog from legendary BBQ joint The Rendezvous, carry it back their truck, butcher it and create a barbeque sauce and dish on the master pit. Stakes are high as the dishes are judged by Jim Neely, the godfather of Memphis barbeque. The teams begin to sell in the city, when Tyler calls with the Speed Bump: for the remainder of the weekend, the teams may not sell any dishes with meat. On the second day of selling, Tyler adds another game changer when informs the teams a local food blogger is presenting immunity from elimination to the truck with the best vegetarian dining experience.\n\n**This was downloaded from a website so the quality is a little sub-par, but it's very watchable.
