This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 6 - Wednesday - Tonight the contestants head to the Shangri La Hotel for a mammoth 24 hour cooking challenge that will push them to their limits. Divided into two teams, they must work shifts to cover all meals. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccdde27a631a350777d56c04edb5c9ea017c7e71","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E34.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccdde27a631a350777d56c04edb5c9ea017c7e71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,221,226,122,99,26,53,7,119,213,108,4,237,181,201,234,1,124,126,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
