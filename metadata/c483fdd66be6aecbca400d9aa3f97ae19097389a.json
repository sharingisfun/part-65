Best known for her stage roles in The Lion King and Aida -- the latter won her a Tony -- the Trinidad native is used to arch performance. Yet her debut album focuses on smooth, lean R&amp;B grooves and Headley's honeyed voice. Heartbreak is Headley's ace. &quot;I Wish I Wasn't&quot; is a tortured missive dispatched from an empty home. &quot;Always Been Your Girl&quot; -- the set's hands-down centerpiece -- finds Headley pleading with a longtime friend to consider her in a different light. It's a staggeringly powerful song -- the kind you can imagine Headley belting out beneath a stark spotlight -- made all the more stunning by the fact that the whole collection isn't tied to that one emotion. Also here are the breezy, Mars-Venus meditation &quot;Nature of a Man&quot; and the near-tribal thump of &quot;Like Ya Used To.&quot; There are producers and guests aplenty, but Headley is, as always, the star of the show.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nThough she didn't come out of the R&amp;B tradition, Heather Headley has plenty of soul on her debut, This Is Who I Am. Headley, a singer whose vocal strength isn't mere compensation for a lack of interpretive skills or lame songwriting, possesses a range that's surprising and welcome; she slips on dramatic personas continually here, quite ironic considering the title. The arrangements aren't exactly hooky, but the cast of producers -- including Dallas Austin, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and D'Influence, use everything in their power -- from a Hammond B-3 to synthesizers -- to flesh out these songs. Occasionally, the songs don't reflect their age very well, as on the regrets of a stay-at-home girlfriend (&quot;I Wish I Wasn't&quot;) or an increasingly angry housewife who's been neglected (&quot;Like Ya Used To&quot;). The opener, &quot;He Is&quot; (by songwriter/producer Joshua Nile), is very good though -- an intriguing angle on female thoughts about the male side of love (or, just possibly, a look at the aspects of God). Headley sounds excellent throughout, her voice pure as crystal on the ballads, occasionally outrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in similar fashion to Mariah Carey, but gritty and soulful when she's sorting out the responsibilities of a relationship in &quot;Fulltime.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c483fdd66be6aecbca400d9aa3f97ae19097389a","amp;dn":"Heather+Headley+-+This+Is+Who+I+Am","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c483fdd66be6aecbca400d9aa3f97ae19097389a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,131,253,214,107,230,174,203,202,64,13,154,163,249,122,225,144,151,56,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
