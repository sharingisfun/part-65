It appears that some kind soul has taken the time to fix some of the issues so that it is at least playable.  For Conquest fans, this is the Holy Grail....as I said, it was never officially released and the playable pre-beta version is VERY hard to acquire.  PLEASE seed this if you DL and like it.  Perhaps some other kind soul will tweak it further or fix it entirely but....I'm not holding my breath on that.  As it is, it can be played with few issues (and those appear to be minor).  I hope you enjoy this release as much as I have.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f514f1834aaf453bf12380eb2fdc711767920e70","amp;dn":"Conquest%3A++The+Vyrium+Uprising","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f514f1834aaf453bf12380eb2fdc711767920e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,20,241,131,74,175,69,59,241,35,128,235,47,220,113,23,103,146,14,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
