Adask is the founder of one of the largest legal reform organizations, Citizens for Legal Reform. He ran for the Texas Supreme Court in 1992 and received 201,000 votes. Earlier this year, he was the target of a CBS 60 Minutes hit piece on the Sovereign Citizen movement. In response, Adask penned a piece entitled &quot;Am I About To Be Labeled a 'Domestic Terrorist'?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
