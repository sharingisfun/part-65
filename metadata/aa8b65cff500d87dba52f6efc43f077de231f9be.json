After centuries of relying on hired samurai for national defense, the Japanese monarchy has decided to do away with the warriors in favor of a more contemporary military. Tom Cruise stars as Nathan Algren, a veteran of the U.S. Civil War who is hired by the Emperor Meiji to train an army capable of wiping out the samurai. But when Algren is captured by the samurai and taught about their history and way of life, he finds himself conflicted over who he should be fighting alongside. Billy Connelly, Tony Goldwyn, and Ken Watanabe co-star.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 34 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 608\n\nFrame Height: 256\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 115kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa8b65cff500d87dba52f6efc43f077de231f9be","amp;dn":"The+Last+Samurai%282003%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa8b65cff500d87dba52f6efc43f077de231f9be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,139,101,207,245,0,216,125,186,82,246,239,196,63,7,125,226,49,249,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
