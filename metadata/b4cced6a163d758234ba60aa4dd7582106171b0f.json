The pair then embark on a quest to replace it. After stealing and destroying a TV from school (resulting in their expulsion) and ruining the TV in Tom Anderson's camper, they visit a low-quality motel that advertises &quot;TVs in every room.&quot; There they encounter a drunken Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) who is waiting for two hired hit men, the same guys who stole Beavis and Butt-Head's television, to murder his wife, Dallas.\n\nMuddy, thinking that Beavis and Butt-Head are the killers he has contacted, says that they must &quot;do&quot; (murder) his wife. Thinking that by &quot;do&quot;, Muddy means &quot;score with&quot;, Butt-Head convinces Beavis that both of them can &quot;score&quot;. Muddy then hands them a photograph of Dallas with instructions on where to find her. Beavis asks if they can watch TV first, and Muddy subsequently shoots it. He drives them to the airport in his Lincoln Continental Mark V to catch the plane to her hotel room on the Las Vegas Strip. During the plane ride, both Beavis and Butt-Head manage to cause chaos and Beavis consumes massive quantities of caffeine pills given to him by an old woman (Cloris Leachman). He subsequently transforms into Cornholio, and almost causes the plane to crash when be barges into the cockpit and scares the pilots.\n\nAfter causing a mild stir in a Las Vegas casino, the boys find themselves in their hotel room, which is adjacent to the room of the hunted woman, Dallas Grimes (voiced by Demi Moore). Dallas soon realizes they have no idea what they were actually hired for. While Beavis and Butt-Head begin fighting over who will &quot;do&quot; Dallas first, the police arrive to arrest her. Thinking quickly, she plants a stolen biological weapon known as the &quot;X-5 Unit&quot; in Beavis' pants in order to get rid of it as evidence. She then gets them tickets on a tour bus to Washington, D.C. instructing them that she will be waiting for them in the Capitol of the United States and will let them &quot;do her&quot; there.\n\nThe stolen biological weapon attracts the attention of the ATF, headed by Agent Flemming (Robert Stack) who orders a body cavity search on everyone he encounters and in spite of his tough talk, relies on fellow Agent Bork's (an uncredited Greg Kinnear) assistance, virtually all the time. Agent Flemming becomes convinced that the pair are criminal masterminds after they accidentally destroy the Hoover Dam, by effectively cutting the power to Las Vegas. On the tour bus, they visit landmarks including the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park. After becoming stranded in Petrified Forest National Park, they wander through the desert and meet two drifters (Earl Hofert and Tony Darling) who strongly resemble them. The men, former Motley Crue roadies, tell them that they once hooked up with two &quot;sluts&quot; from the boys' hometown of Highland, Texas, 15 years earlier. They also share similar personalities, as evidenced by Beavis' father's fascination with fire, and Butt-head's father's pulling down his pants and farting in the fire, creating a large fireball. Neither the men nor the boys make the obvious connection of their parentage, and the drifters abandon Beavis and Butt-head before they wake up the next morning. The boys then continue to trek through the desert, and, after munching on a peyote cactus, Beavis goes into a mescaline induced hallucination, featuring music by White Zombie with animation inspired by Rob Zombie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalisi Audio Video\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : D:\\Beavis and Butt-Head Do America 1996 720p ITA ENG.mkv\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 4.44 GiB\nDuration : 1h 17mn\nOverall bit rate : 8 207 Kbps\nMovie name : Beavis and Butt-Head Do America 1996 720p HDTV x264-DNL\nEncoded date : UTC 2011-07-07 15:22:24\nWriting application : mkvmerge v4.3.0 ('Escape from the Island') built on Sep 5 2010 10:30:51\nWriting library : libebml v1.0.0 + libmatroska v1.0.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d098b9b7b8909ce4fee1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 8 frames\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 1h 17mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 7 700 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 25.0 Mbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.334\nStream size : 4.08 GiB (92%)\nWriting library : x264 core 114 r1924 08d04a4\n\nAudio #1\nID : 2\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : A_MPEG/L3\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 17mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nStream size : 71.0 MiB (2%)\nLanguage : Italian\n\nAudio #2\nID : 3\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 1h 17mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nStream size : 213 MiB (5%)\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4cced6a163d758234ba60aa4dd7582106171b0f","amp;dn":"Beavis+and+Butt-Head+Do+America+%5BHDTVrip+720p+ENG+ITA%5D+nautilus-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4cced6a163d758234ba60aa4dd7582106171b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,204,237,106,22,61,117,130,52,186,96,170,77,215,88,33,6,23,27,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
