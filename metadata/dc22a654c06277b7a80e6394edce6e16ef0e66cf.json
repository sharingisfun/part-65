It showcases a small group that features string players in the front line. Ray Nance, the Duke's own violinist, is here as is the legendary Stephane Grappelli and violist Svend Asmussen. The rest of the players include tenor man Paul Gonsalves, drummer Sam Woodyard, bassist Ernie Shepard, alto saxist Russell Procope, and trombonist Buster Cooper. Ellington plays piano on all but two tunes where Billy Strayhorn replaced him. The program is a collection of Ellington and Strayhorn standards from &quot;Blues in C&quot; and &quot;Take the 'A' Train,&quot; to &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore,&quot; &quot;Cotton Tail,&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Limbo Jazz.&quot; The soloist and group interplay are gentle, swinging, and utterly and completely graceful and elegant. There is a lighthearted tenderness in this set that borders on sentimentality without ever going there. And the feeling is loose, relaxed, and full of warmth throughout. \n\n01.
