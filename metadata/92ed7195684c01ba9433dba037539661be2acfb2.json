After his  parents are  killed in  car accident,  Cody is left\n        dealing with  enormous guilt,  caring for  his younger brother\n        and the persistent thought of how to bring his parents back to\n        life. Cody knows he is not the first person to have this  idea\n        or the  first to  have attempted  to carry  it through.  After\n        several attempts with  his electromagnetic device,  he becomes\n        the first to breach the wall between the living and the  dead.\n        But where is the line between life and death? And who actually\n        comes back? What  ghosts come out  of the machine?  &quot;Phasma Ex\n        Machina&quot; is a sci-fi film that combines both heart and mystery\n        with electronic veins and sheet metal. \n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                  Sasha Andreev      ....
