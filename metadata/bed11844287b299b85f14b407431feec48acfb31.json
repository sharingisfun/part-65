What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 3 - friday - it's a mega MasterClass tonight as Gary and Matt Moran teach the top 21 contestants about raw foods, herbs, and oils. Later Gary whips up a mushroom gnocchi and his 'Mum's Lamb Stew with Dumplings'.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed11844287b299b85f14b407431feec48acfb31","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E18.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed11844287b299b85f14b407431feec48acfb31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,209,24,68,40,123,41,155,133,241,75,64,116,49,254,236,72,172,251,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
