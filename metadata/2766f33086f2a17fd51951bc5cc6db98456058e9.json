Unfortunately due to various reasons I cannot upload it here. You can google it.\n\n\nThis includes the following changes:\n\nAdded:\n\n* 1988 Rare Foreign Singles (thanks to Dropkix)\n- A dutch version of the album that includes songs in german and spanish. Read the txt file in the album folder for more details.\n\n* 1955 So Doggone Lonesome / Folsom Prison Blues (thanks to patjade)\n- Single taken from a '78 vinyl\n\nNOTE: Please note this is just a small update to the other torrent, thus it contains the same directory structure and updated text and catalog files. Just copy the folder over your previous one.\n\nAlso if you are still seeding the previous torrent, do not overwrite the Catalog (htm) files since that will probably give you an error.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2766f33086f2a17fd51951bc5cc6db98456058e9","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+The+First+Complete+Discography+%28HQ%29+-+Update+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2766f33086f2a17fd51951bc5cc6db98456058e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,102,243,48,134,242,161,127,213,25,81,188,92,198,219,152,69,96,88,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
