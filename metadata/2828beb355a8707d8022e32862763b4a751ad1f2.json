Each bullies those ranking beneath him; tensions are high. PFC Kang and his friend Private Kim are on patrol when drinking youths jeer them. Two nights later, Kang follows orders, opening fire at a person who has infiltrated the border zone. It proves to be a young man, one from the earlier encounter, on a drunken tryst with his girlfriend, Mi-yeong. Kang is commended, yet horrified. Mi-yeong is unhinged. Kim tries to hold onto friendship, duty, and his humanity. While Kang retreats into bizarre behavior and violence, Mi-yeong becomes easy prey to soldiers. Sickness is all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2828beb355a8707d8022e32862763b4a751ad1f2","amp;dn":"The+Coast+Guard+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2828beb355a8707d8022e32862763b4a751ad1f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,40,190,179,85,168,112,125,128,34,227,40,98,118,59,74,117,26,209,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
