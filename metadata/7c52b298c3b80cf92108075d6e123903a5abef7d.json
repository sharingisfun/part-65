The first day I usually get about 30 to 40 seeds the next day its down to 4 or less.\n\nUnexpected and very disappointing. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to upload music (that took me quite a while to collect en select) to a bunch of selfish, greedy ghosts.\n\nIn exception of the Indie playlists (a new beginning that everyone should listen), I closed my outstanding torrents. This one will be my last.\n\nIf you have comments leave it here.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c52b298c3b80cf92108075d6e123903a5abef7d","amp;dn":"Dutch+Treat+-+088+For+You+%28Tracy+Chapman+HQ+MP3+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c52b298c3b80cf92108075d6e123903a5abef7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,82,178,152,195,184,12,249,33,8,7,93,110,18,57,3,165,171,239,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
