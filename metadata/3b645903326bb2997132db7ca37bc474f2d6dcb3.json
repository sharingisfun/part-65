Professor Juniper gives Ash a new Pokdex and Pok \n        Balls so he can begin his journey in Unova. On his way, he comes \n         across Iris and her Axew. When Team Rocket appears and tries to \n        steal Pikachu and Axew, Ash tries to use his newly caught Pidove \n           against Jessie and her new Woobat, but Pidove is not strong   \n        enough. However, an Oshawott appears and saves Pikachu and Axew. \n       Ash and Iris take Pikachu, Pidove, and Axew to a Pokmon Center so\n        their health can be restored. Iris decides to travel with Ash and\n         Pikachu through Unova, as she knows her way around the region.  \n                     Meanwhile, Oshawott watches from afar.              \n\n     \n                                           \n                    RIP NOTES                    \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n         Pokemon was way cooler when there was only 151 of them.
