The album was the first official Guns N Roses release since The Spaghetti Incident released on the same day in 1993. Former guitarist Slash notes that the album is, not pretty and there are a lot of mistakes, but this is Guns N Roses, not the fucking Mahavishnu Orchestra.

Artwork included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2fa9134d245446189bf5648138627f84f2b3e29","amp;dn":"GUNS+N+ROSES+Live+%2787-%2793+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2fa9134d245446189bf5648138627f84f2b3e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,250,145,52,210,69,68,97,137,191,86,72,19,134,39,248,79,43,62,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
