Far to the east of the mountains in\n  hostile marshlands, the race of the Firbolgs united in ancient times and\n  formed a shamanistic culture. Although the Humans often call them 'Savages',\n  the Firbolgs are proud and just people. They are born in war, they live to\n  fight and die in the name of the War God. \n\n  Little is known about the fearsome Ghosts. The knowledge of their origin\n  seems lost in present days. However many of the scholars believe they are\n  souls, that are bound to the world until they achieve the right to find rest\n  in the true death. \n\n  Almost nothing is known about the Elementals. Actually many believe they\n  haven't existed at all. They are source of legends and myths and none has\n  been able to see them for many generations. \n\n  At the present the Kingdom of Dumnoni tries to expand towards the territories\n  of the Firbolgs and force them to kneel to the crown. A goal that proved not\n  easy to achieve as the time revealed. The race of men is separated however by\n  religious disjunction and many people disagree that the mighty kings of\n  Dumnoni are true bearers of the will of gods. \n\n  Features\n  * Create a leader choosing from four available races (Human, Firbolg, \n    Elemental and Ghost) with two classes each (warrior and mage).
