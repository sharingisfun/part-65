Based on a lifetime of stargazing, Schaaf lists his personal favoritesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the 50 most thrilling sights to be seen in the heavens: a comet, Orion's Belt, the Andromeda Galaxy, the planet Neptune, a meteor shower, sunspots, a supernova, and on and on. Schaaf begins with some basic information and terminology (altazimuth system, for example, or right ascension) and then plunges right in with the most easily accessible astronomical sight, the starry sky above our heads. For each sight, he not only explains what it is and the best conditions under which to observe it, he also tells us about its historical, mythological, or scientific importance and explores how these far-off wonders can have a very real effect on our humble home world. This could so easily have been a dry-as-dust tome, but Schaaf's enthusiasm overflows every page. How could you not love a book about astronomy whose author tells you the date of his favorite planetary conjunction? (It was June 4, 1978, when Mars and Saturn got to within 0.1 degrees of each other.) Just a wonderful book. Pitt, David\nReview\n&quot;...an excellent volume...I would recommend this book to any budding astronomer.&quot;  (Astronomy Now, January 2008)\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 288 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (July 27, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0471696579\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0471696575","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f030ea9176b17126fdbff70bad4ad26405623586","amp;dn":"The+50+Best+Sights+in+Astronomy+and+How+to+See+Them%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f030ea9176b17126fdbff70bad4ad26405623586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,48,234,145,118,177,113,38,253,191,247,11,173,74,210,100,5,98,53,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
