A vein-bursting, twisting, and turning supernatural noir overflowing with deception and double-dealing. A grimy NYC mystery in the tradition of the pulp masters of the 1940's.\n\nMichael Farrow is out for revenge after he catches the rawest of raw deals. Both his book and muse, Missy, are cold jacked by the same icy bastard, Percy Featherton, the legendary publishing czar of New York City.\n\nWhen Farrow finally tracks down Percy, he shows up a little too late. The dirty old man welcomes him lying on the ground, eyes rolled to the back of his head, staining the fancy townhouse with more guts than ink. Missy of course is nowhere to be found.\n\nNo writer in NYC is safe. Gothic scribes with cult followings are bleeding under stained glass. Golden child authors are swandiving from the top of New York Public Library defiling their legacy. Scumbag cops, Detective Anderson and Sgt. Bethany Powers are slaps away from exposing the shady deal Farrow cut with Featherton.
