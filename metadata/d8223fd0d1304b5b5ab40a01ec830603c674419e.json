Thanks!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first novelÃ¢â‚¬â€first of many, I hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€is both sweet and savory, built on the foundations of a quirky Texas town that feels like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been hiding out there in the desert, woven through with genuinely clever storytelling. The story unfolds like a tale told on a wraparound porch to the clink of iced tea glasses. Fisher creates a world where angels and demons are as delightfully believable as the perfect peach pie, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m eagerly looking forward to the next slice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Dianne Sylvan, author of The Shadow World series)\n\nEmpathic pie baker Gracey Daylittle has lived a quiet life in the desert of Love &amp; War, Texas, for ten years. But when she and her sister unwittingly rescue an insatiable Japanese demon from the side of the road, her world descends into a maelstrom of mythic chaos that threatens to destroy her town and the foundations sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built her life upon.\n\nA delicious fusion of Mexican and Japanese mythologies, the first book in the Love &amp; War series is sure to delight urban fantasy and magical realism fans everywhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8223fd0d1304b5b5ab40a01ec830603c674419e","amp;dn":"Curse+for+Gracey+Daylittle%2C+A+-+Amber+Fisher.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8223fd0d1304b5b5ab40a01ec830603c674419e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,34,63,208,209,48,75,91,90,180,10,1,236,131,6,3,198,116,65,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
