Ellis Henican argues that regulation is needed.\n\nReason's Nick Gillespie contends that American culture is not in decline. People read sensational stories like this, this, or this. But when you look at data for things like teen drug use and pregnancy, and violent crime, it suggests that American kids have become more responsible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fd4b4ca31a4ce133058bf6c05488e7297851ab2","amp;dn":"20120607-Stossel-%5BDecline+Whine%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fd4b4ca31a4ce133058bf6c05488e7297851ab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,212,180,202,49,164,206,19,48,88,191,108,5,72,142,114,151,133,26,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
