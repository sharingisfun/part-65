You can mount and manipulate hard drives and partitions, monitor networks, rebuild boot records, install other operating systems, and much more. Finnix includes the latest technology for system administrators, with Linux kernel 2.6, LVM2, encrypted partitions, etc. And above all, Finnix is small; currently the entire distribution is over 300MiB, but is dynamically compressed into a small bootable image. Finnix is not intended for the average desktop user, and does not include any desktops, productivity tools, or sound support, in order to keep distribution size low. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.finnix.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.finnix.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : f102ff6104d1e2e023a64417184440dd  finnix-ppc-102.iso\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddda5494aa4d09267c53d1b68542dc46b033cbe1","amp;dn":"finnix-ppc-102.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddda5494aa4d09267c53d1b68542dc46b033cbe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,218,84,148,170,77,9,38,124,83,209,182,133,66,220,70,176,51,203,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
