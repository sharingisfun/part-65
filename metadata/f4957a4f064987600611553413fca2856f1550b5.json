From cats that saved their owners' lives to swanky cat-only hotels, the series spans the realm of all things &quot;cat.&quot; It offers a potpourri of amazing feline stories, jam-packed with interesting factoids and trivia bits. The show is hosted by musician John Fulton, who combines his love for ditties with kitties. He is on a mission to prove to himself and the world that America is filled -north to south, east to west - with cat lovers, and is in fact a Cat-nation.\n\ns01e01 - Cat Poo Coffee and Klepto Kitties\ns01e02 - Kitty Tree Houses and The Cat Guys\ns01e03 - Cat Musicians and Garfield's Dad\ns01e04 - Kitty Fashion Plates and NYC's Best Mousers\ns01e05 - Kitty Wigs and Fat Cats\ns01e06 - Cat Colleges and Kitty Heroes\n\n\ns02e01 - Cat Crazy in Japan \ns02e02 - Tough Guys and Acupuncture Saves Cats \ns02e03 - English Kitties and Stowaway Cats \ns02e04 - Kitty Kidney Transplants and the Cat Who Jogs \ns02e05 - Swimming Cats and Cat Fur Jewels \ns02e06 - Prison Kitties and Apps for Cats","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4957a4f064987600611553413fca2856f1550b5","amp;dn":"Must+Love+Cats+-+Animal+Planet+-+seasons+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4957a4f064987600611553413fca2856f1550b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,149,122,79,6,73,135,96,6,17,85,52,19,252,162,133,111,21,80,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
