So a question you might be asking is what\nexactly is LUA? Well, it's a lightweight, powerful, and embeddable scripting language.\nIt is currently the leading scripting language in games and has been used in commercial programs\nranging from Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom to World of Warcraft.\nThe clever aspect about the LUA scripting language is the fact that it does not need to be compiled.\nThis lua player allows users to display images, geometric shapes, display text,\nand collect data from the SIXAXIS DualShock3 controller, among other things.\nThis version of Lua player does not include sound or file management functions,\nbut the developer promises these features in the next revision.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc999fc8358261cf5b0caca50732cb339d9533db","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+LuaFPS3+v0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc999fc8358261cf5b0caca50732cb339d9533db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,153,159,200,53,130,97,207,91,12,172,165,7,50,203,51,157,149,51,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
