Its hard enough to be The Living Corpse - the flies, the hunger for human brains, and the unending task of holding off the hordes of darkness from creeping into the world of the living... But when a Nosferatu suddenly moves into his graveyard, all hell breaks loose! And what will happen when The Living Corpses friend, Lilith, gets caught in the middle? Its a battle of the undead and only one will be left standing! (here is a hint -- the name of the book ain't Nosferatu!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4016865810beef84b90ca93959bc2603fa4e169b","amp;dn":"The+Living+Corpse+-+Exhumed+%231.+Dynamite+comics+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4016865810beef84b90ca93959bc2603fa4e169b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,22,134,88,16,190,239,132,185,12,169,57,89,188,38,3,250,78,22,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
