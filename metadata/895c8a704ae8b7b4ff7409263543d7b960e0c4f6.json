Hess and Medina host Truth Exposed Radio. \n\nAlex is also joined by Tony Farrell, who served with British South Yorkshire Police for 12 years as a Police Intelligence Analyst. It was Farrell's job to produce annual Strategic Threat Assessment Matrix reports as part of counter-terror operations. When Farrell discovered damning evidence that both 7/7 and 9/11 were false flag attacks, he blew the whistle and told his superiors that &quot;internal tyranny&quot; and &quot;state sponsored terror&quot; were far greater threats than Islamic radicalism. Despite several of his superiors agreeing with him, Farrell was subsequently dismissed and his case is currently on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
