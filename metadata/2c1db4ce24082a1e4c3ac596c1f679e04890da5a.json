This special Dispatches programme features extraordinary access to those directly involved, including devastated parents desperately searching for their stolen son, a man who brokers the deals and has sold his own offspring, and prospective parents grappling with giving up their soon-to-be-born daughter.\n\nBeautiful, haunting and deeply tragic, this film takes us into the heart of modern China - a place where girl babies are being sold for as little as Ã‚Â£200, detectives specialise in finding kidnapped children and child traffickers buy and sell human lives. The film provides an intimate portrait of the crisis that this stringent government policy has created among China's poorest people.\n\nAired 08 October 2007\n\nCan also be viewed from the UK at 4oD: [url]http://www.channel4.com/programmes/4od[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c1db4ce24082a1e4c3ac596c1f679e04890da5a","amp;dn":"Dispatches%3A+China%27s+Stolen+Children+08-10-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c1db4ce24082a1e4c3ac596c1f679e04890da5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,29,180,206,36,8,42,30,76,58,197,150,193,246,121,224,72,144,218,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
