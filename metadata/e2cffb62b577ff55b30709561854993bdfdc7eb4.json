Brace yourself for a ride into diversity, \n deep bass and mind-blowing new versions of the (future) classics \n youÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºve come to love. \n\n The first Volume of Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Hands On ArmadaÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº was launched with the expertise \n of producer Alex M.O.R.P.H. It brought something refreshingly new and \n creative, pointing out the art of remixing and showcasing the sound \n of the German producer. Volume 1 featured 19 of ArmadaÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs old and new \n classics, given a fine remix stir by Alex. The Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Hands On ArmadaÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº \n series brings together the past and present, providing longevity of \n music. \n\n Old and new go hand in hand on Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Hands On ArmadaÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. ThatÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs exactly what \n makes Dabruck &amp; Klein the perfect candidates for the second Volume of \n the beloved series. Working together for more than 10 years, earning \n their stripes as DJÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs, producers and label-owners and creating \n remixes for the likes of Armin van Buuren, Axwell, Sebastian \n Ingrosso, Roger Sanchez, Mark Knight, Moby, Bob Sinclair, Public \n Enemy, Tocadisco, Joachim Garraud, Dada life, to name but a few, has \n made the Dabruck &amp; Klein sound hot property. Within a flash of 4 \n years, the Dabruck &amp; Klein have remixes more than 60 tracks, so be \n sureÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¯these guys know how to handle the tunes! \n\n Last year, the duo has released their debut album, Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹2:48 AMÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº, an ode \n to that peak time moment on the dance floor. Expect to find that same \n diversity of sound on Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Hands On Armada Vol. 2Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Âº, as Dabruck &amp; Klein \n rock you with remixes of high quality prog, house and trance.
