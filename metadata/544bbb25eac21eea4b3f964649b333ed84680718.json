Were it not for defense attorneys and the work of human rights organizations, these prisoners would be ignored. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changing.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the international literary and human rights group PEN have teamed up to comb through 150,000 declassified documents Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as large collections of articles and transcripts Ã¢â‚¬â€ to produce [i]The Torture Report: What the Documents Say About AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Post-9/11 Torture Program[/i], written by PENÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Larry Siems. PEN and the ACLU have also staged readings of excerpts from the documents and first-person testimony at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah and Lincoln Center here in New York.\n\nThose readings have been videotaped and are being made into a documentary by movie director Doug Liman called [i]Reckoning with Torture[/i]. Liman is now asking people across the country to videotape their own readings of declassified memos and testimonies for the project.

We made grave, serious mistakes of judgment,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Siems tells Moyers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“And we would be stronger as a nation, if we stood up and said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe did these things. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sorry. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gonna do better.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEpisode webpage: [url]http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-reckoning-with-torture/[/url]\n\n-----\n\nType: mp4 file\nSize: 286MB\nRuntime: 00:56:46\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x360\nAudio: AAC 44100Hz stereo 108Kbps \n\nYou can also watch a flash video of this episode through your web-browser here:\n[url]http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-reckoning-with-torture/[/url]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:544bbb25eac21eea4b3f964649b333ed84680718","amp;dn":"Moyers+and+Company%2C+May+25+2012%3A+Reckoning+with+Torture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"544bbb25eac21eea4b3f964649b333ed84680718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,75,187,37,234,194,30,234,75,63,150,70,73,179,51,237,132,104,7,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
