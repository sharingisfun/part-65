His breakthrough album Guitarland (1994) caused the Swedish TV program Jazz duel to dub him successor to Rune Gustafsson - godfather of Swedish jazz guitar since the 1950s.\n\nProduced by fellow guitarist Peter Friestedt, Sunset in Guitarland features some of the most iconic studio legends in Los Angeles. Michael Ruff and Bill Cantos offer outstanding vocal and keyboard performances. Behind the drums we find John JR Robinson - considered one of the world's most recorded drummers and immortalized for his contributions to Michael Jackson's Bad and Off the Wall - and Ralph Humphrey, who has played with everybody from Frank Zappa to Wayne Shorter.\n- I saw Ralph with Zappa at the Concert Hall in Gothenburg at the age of 14. He was fantastic on both Over-Nite Sensation and Apostrophe, when Zappa was in the gap between hard rock and jazz, Rolf says.\nSunset in Guitarland also includes great contributions from Brazilian drummer Cuca Teixeira and renowned Swedes Ulf Wakenius (guitar), Lars Danielsson (bass), Per Lindvall (drums) and Dan Evmark (keyboards).
