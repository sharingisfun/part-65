The sound of the recordings in the two editions vary and in many cases they are top quality - in some cases the recordings come from the studio originals and have been transferred with care to preserve the top quality to the digital audio file. In a few other cases, the sound has suffered badly when others have chosen a much too low bitrate. I am sorry that some do not realize that sound has an important role in radio, and the sound quality is important for the experience. Kenny Everett was obviously very concerned about sound quality, but unfortunately there is not always this concern among his fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00bd4b05be19289d3082e2ac350d9d1444f4588","amp;dn":"Kenny+Everett%2C+The+Wireless+Wizard%2C+part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00bd4b05be19289d3082e2ac350d9d1444f4588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,11,212,176,91,225,146,137,211,8,46,42,195,80,217,209,68,79,69,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
