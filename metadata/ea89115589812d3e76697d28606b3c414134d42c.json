Injuries and obsession bite into strategy and preparation, and as he moves closer to the finish line his insights on how much running is too much, his reflection on previous training and lingering injuries, and his philosophy of finishing begins to compromise his ability to go the distance.\n\n Joining in with Mark is friend and antagonist, Scott Guild.  Scott was introduced to the HURT and ultra running by Mark, but his perspective of the race differs.  New to ultra running and the HURT 100, Scott is rolling the dice for the finishing line.  Showing the excitement, challenge, and heart of running, he takes us into the places of the race where only champions go.  Introducing the faces, the pain, and the deep-rooted drive that pushes each one of us to reach for the finish line. He finds himself against a wall of time and scrambling to get over it.\n\n Together through the film, the two of them take you on 4:00 AM 40-mile morning runs, 45-story corporate workouts, 20-mile redwood weekend jogs, and  deep into the sections and segments of the HURT 100 course that give it its name.  You see the preparation, feel the physical challenge, and taste mental angst that only the HURT can bring out.  And in the end come away with more than just a finishers belt buckle. \n\nWatch as they join the rest of the HURT runners in the struggle to make the cut-off time and find the finish line.  Follow the count down of training to get to the starting line.  Meet the faces, hear the strategy, and go deep into the heart of the course, as we break down what it means to run the HURT 100 in, Profiling HURT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea89115589812d3e76697d28606b3c414134d42c","amp;dn":"Profiling+HURT+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea89115589812d3e76697d28606b3c414134d42c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,137,17,85,137,129,45,62,118,105,125,40,96,107,60,65,65,52,212,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
