It gives you a central point from which you can analyze and act upon emails and files that have been quarantined such as spam, phish, viruses, potentially unwanted content or any other undesirable content. It is effective in managing unsolicited bulk emails or spam. No anti-spam filter is capable of detecting all of the spam that flows through a network. Occasionally some emails may incorrectly be identified as spam. Administrators and users increasingly want to tune anti-spam products to suit their own environments and increase the effectiveness of their spam filtering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb106bd2c208b34d862ea720007cbf764cf8bc8e","amp;dn":"McAfee.Quarantine.Manager.v7.0.1.RETAIL-Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb106bd2c208b34d862ea720007cbf764cf8bc8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,16,107,210,194,8,179,77,134,46,167,32,0,124,191,118,76,248,188,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
