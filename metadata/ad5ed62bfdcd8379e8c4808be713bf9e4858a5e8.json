It's quite a find. Essentially, this is a modernist folk record for those who like their folk subject matter to remain reassuringly &quot;traditional&quot;, which means that fans of murder, copulation, insanity, infidelity and drowning in rivers won't be disappointed. But transvestism? And spiders? And--on the Charlotte Perkins Gilman inspired title track--a philandering cad of a husband who keeps his wife locked in the attic? Yes, this is a queer old record, deliciously embroidered with strange musical arrangements--parlour room piano by gaslight, queasy strings, a forlorn concertina, creepy woodwind--and some great tunes, viz the jazz-tinged Pentangle vibe of &quot;Ramble My Rose&quot; and the poppy mania of &quot;Marmalade Duke&quot;. Savvy and saucy (&quot;Ooh you pulled my knickers down and you left me by the kitchen sink&quot; she sings on &quot;Knickers&quot;) Screwing Lies could be the beginning of an intriguing career.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/05/katy-carr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/05/katy-carr/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5ed62bfdcd8379e8c4808be713bf9e4858a5e8","amp;dn":"Katy+Carr...Screwing+Lies%282000%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5ed62bfdcd8379e8c4808be713bf9e4858a5e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,94,214,43,253,205,131,121,232,196,128,139,231,19,191,158,72,88,165,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
