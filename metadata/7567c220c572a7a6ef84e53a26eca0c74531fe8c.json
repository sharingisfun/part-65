Dan Rosenthal (drums) joined the duo soon after, and the three forged what (to them at least) seems like a fairly unprecedented bondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a bond strengthened by their common love of melody-driven punk rock, or just punk, or post punk, or pop punk, or... But really, they just genuinely like each other and they like playing music together, and all of this comes through in their live shows as well as their recordings.\n\nCAVE BABYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eponymous debut release (digitally released on June 21st, 2011, with physical copies on August 6th, 2011) is a tightly wound manifestation of CAVE BABYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recording philosophy and features 7 songs delivered in just under 22 minutes. It was recorded to 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tape over the course of two snowy days by Dale Morningstar (God- speed You! Black Emperor, Julie Doiron) at the Gas Station on Toronto Island, mixed by CAVE BABY, and mastered by Shawn Jurek (Oh No Forest Fires, The Wilderness of Manitoba). A 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ vinyl record release, entitled Moscow, will follow in October 2011, com- pleting their last remaining childhood dream.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7567c220c572a7a6ef84e53a26eca0c74531fe8c","amp;dn":"CAVE+BABY+-+CAVE+BABY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7567c220c572a7a6ef84e53a26eca0c74531fe8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,103,194,32,197,114,167,166,239,132,229,58,38,236,160,199,69,49,254,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
