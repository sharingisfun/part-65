Such a Fool\n\n\nI remember passing the Band of SkullsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tent as evening set in at Bonnaroo last summer, thinking Ã¢â‚¬Å“hot damn, they sound amazingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while trudging off to another show. Now I sincerely wish I stopped to receive an adequate face melting upon hearing Sweet Sour, the Southampton, England trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second LP that sizzles with muscle-driven, sludgy honest-to-goodness rock. A British powerhouse borrowing from the best early aughts sounds, Band of SkullsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ clean tone and unabashed take on rock positively scorches at every point on the album.\n\nSweet Sour centers on a fresh, more streamlined sound than the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rowdy breakthrough debut, Baby Darling Doll Face Honey. Luckily the gritty guitar rock and fury is still present, polished and packaged here as shiny, modern rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll thanks to producer Ian Davenport. With this 10-track album, Band of Skulls essentially carry the flag of guitar, bass, and drum trios where other acts have grown fatigued and clichÃƒÂ©d.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sweet SourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ leads the album with balanced vocal harmonies to lessen the blow of in-your-face instrumentals, the yowling lyrics (Ã¢â‚¬Å“sour by the minute but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sweeter by the hourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), punctuating the metal-esque trills and doomsday drums and bass. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Devil Takes Care of His OwnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s blazing three minutes highlight the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ferocious, venue-dominating authority that aptly rears its head even on the sultrier tracks (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay My Head DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The former track sounds wrought from hell itself: ambling guitars, howling slides, and mighty vocals provide a heavy metal assault to the ears.\n\nThroughout the album, the dueling harmonies from guitarists/vocalists Russell Marsden and Emma Richardson situate the vast, humid instrumentation in romantic territory, drawing similarities to My Morning JacketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killer guitar rock in contrast to Jim JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ innocent yet howling falsetto (Ã¢â‚¬Å“WanderlusterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HometownsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Lyrical content focuses on love, being an outcast, and obligatory rockerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cause: freedom. These themes are at times homogenous, but the hefty axe work and dynamic song formats will entice more than a few ears and likely keep them coming back for more Brit-branded riffs.\n\nEssential Tracks: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet SourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Devil Takes Care of His OwnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“HometownsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9114c0b833a6de010c57a3ff88158473597e47b","amp;dn":"Band+of+Skulls...Sweet+Sour%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9114c0b833a6de010c57a3ff88158473597e47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,17,76,11,131,58,109,224,16,197,122,63,248,129,88,71,53,151,228,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
