Select from 13 boats, ranging from 16-cylinder gas-guzzlers to futuristic prototypes. Each boat handles differently, so you'll have to learn on the fly as you hit jumps at 130 mph. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled, because you just might find a shortcut or two if you're lucky. There are also 12 unique courses to race on: Lost Island, Thunder Park, Arctic Circle, Greek Isles, Lake Powell, The Far East, Venice Canals, Ship Graveyard, New York Disaster, Nile Adventure, Hydro Speedway, and Castle Von Dandy. Take on the computer-controlled boats or challenge a friend with awesome split-screen action. With amazing graphics (for the time) and true-to-life physics, HYDRO THUNDER puts you right in the middle of the action.
