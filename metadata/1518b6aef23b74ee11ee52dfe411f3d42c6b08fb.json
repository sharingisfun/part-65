What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 7 = sunday - MasterChef winning alumni Julie Goodwin, Adam Liaw and Kate Bracks return to the MasterChef kitchen for a superstar mystery box challenge. Who will win on the night?\n\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1518b6aef23b74ee11ee52dfe411f3d42c6b08fb","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E37.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1518b6aef23b74ee11ee52dfe411f3d42c6b08fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,24,182,174,242,59,116,238,17,238,82,223,228,17,243,212,44,107,8,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
