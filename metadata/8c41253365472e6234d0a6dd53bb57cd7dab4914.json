Pendulum\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nSeeing Stars was the first (and only) album by the band Seeing Stars. It is of musical significance, however, because it was essentially intended to be the fifth studio album by UK band All About Eve. In the aftermath of the Ultraviolet album's release - its bad reception and lost recording contract - whilst this album was being recorded in early 1993, lead singer Julianne Regan left the band, and All About Eve disbanded.\n\nThe remaining members of the group, Andy Cousin (bass), Mark Price (drums), and Marty Willson-Piper (guitars and - on this record - lead vocals), continued their work on the album for the longest time. It eventually saw the light of day four years later on the Swedish Border Music label, as a rather limited pressing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c41253365472e6234d0a6dd53bb57cd7dab4914","amp;dn":"Seeing+Stars+%281997%29+eponymous+CD+album+MP3+VBR+HQ+%28former+All+Ab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c41253365472e6234d0a6dd53bb57cd7dab4914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,65,37,51,101,71,46,98,52,208,166,221,83,187,87,205,125,171,73,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
