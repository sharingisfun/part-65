The landing parties begin to see strange sights, such as a White Rabbit a la Alice in Wonderland, Don Juan, and a sword-wielding samurai. Also, Kirk sees (and fights) an image of Finnegan, a rival from his Starfleet Academy days. Spock discovers that the planet seems to be drawing a large amount of energy from the ship's engines, placing the Enterprise in danger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84fd6decb75161d0b13604347b65dc1c8dcd6804","amp;dn":"STAR+TREK+TOS+REMASTERED+1X15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84fd6decb75161d0b13604347b65dc1c8dcd6804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,253,109,236,183,81,97,208,177,54,4,52,123,101,220,28,141,205,104,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
