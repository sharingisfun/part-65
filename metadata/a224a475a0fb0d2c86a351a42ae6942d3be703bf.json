Suddenly, amid the violence and entrenched hatred surrounding an intractable conflict, a simple act of humanity rose above the clamor and captured worldwide attention.\n\nHeart of Jenin tells the story of AhmedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tragic death and his father Ismael KhatibÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey to visit three of the organ recipients two years later. One of AhmedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kidneys went to an Orthodox Jewish girl and his other kidney went to a Bedouin boy. While his parents hesitated to donate AhmedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart, it now beats in the chest of a Druze girl.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI see my son in these children,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Khatib says.\n\nCrossing from northern Israel to the Negev desert and ending up in Jerusalem, Khatib encounters every complexity of the conflict: deep-seated animosity, hardened judgments, and heartfelt generosity. While laying bare the deep divisions between Israelis and Palestinians, Heart of Jenin offers a rare vision of common humanity and hope.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a224a475a0fb0d2c86a351a42ae6942d3be703bf","amp;dn":"Heart+Of+Jenin+-+Das+Herz+Von+Jenin+-+Coeur+De+Jenin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a224a475a0fb0d2c86a351a42ae6942d3be703bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,36,164,117,160,251,13,44,134,163,81,164,42,230,148,45,59,231,3,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
