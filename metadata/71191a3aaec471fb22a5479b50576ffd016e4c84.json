It shares its cast and production team with the Carry On films, but the film is not an official member of the Carry On series.\n\nQuietly competent young Joanna moves with her scatterbrain mother to a country village to take up her first job as District Nurse. She soon overcomes the suspicion of her patients used to someone rather older, while becoming romantically involved with a local farmer - at least until he tries to evict a newly-arrived expectant couple who park their caravan on his land.\n\n1hr 22mins\nResolution 768x576\nDivX bitrate 1000kbps\n2-pass encoding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71191a3aaec471fb22a5479b50576ffd016e4c84","amp;dn":"Nurse+on+Wheels+1963+DVDRiP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71191a3aaec471fb22a5479b50576ffd016e4c84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,25,26,58,174,196,113,251,34,165,71,155,80,87,111,253,1,110,76,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
