An interview on Aucklands BFM with Shihad about the making of the album is also included in the album folder.\n\nFormed in 1988 by high school chums Tom Larkin and Jon Toogood, Shihad began playing in their home town of Wellington, New Zealand, rapidly becoming one of the cities most popular acts.  They are New Zealand's powerhouse of rock!\nReleased in May, 2005- Love Is the New Hate is their sixth album, and yielded the singles &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;All the Young Fascists&quot;, &quot;Shot in the Head&quot;, &quot;Dark Times&quot; and &quot;None of the Above&quot;.\nThe album is considered a return to Shihad's earlier heavier style, after an ill-fated attempt to make it big touring America under the Bush administration. The lyrics themselves are notably darker because of this- and are far more politically-orientated than their earlier material.\nThe album entered the New Zealand music charts at number two, going Gold in its first week of release - and then Platinum two weeks later.\nIn May, 2006, the band released a Limited Edition copy of Love is the New Hate which came with a DVD of the album release performance in Aotea Square in May, 2005.\n\n100% New Zealand Music\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nFYI:\nWhile much New Zealand music is well known at home, in the greater world few are familiar with our household names.  This results in relatively little activity on this and other NZ music torrents.\nFurthermore- In NZ we have broadband capacity and speed limits, while in most of the rest of the world (particularly Europe and America) there are no bandwidth restrictions.\nThese two factors make it difficult to seed new NZ music torrents from NZ.  It is particularly frustrating when leechers in restrictionless countries do not seed back what they download because that makes keeping the torrent alive a slow and costly task.\nPleeeeaaase- help support this torrent by seeding it back for as long as possible.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c6928b53657d2fa48a294e1136937fda21097de","amp;dn":"Shihad+-+Love+Is+The+New+Hate+%26+Live+in+Aotea+Square+2005+%28re-re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c6928b53657d2fa48a294e1136937fda21097de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,105,40,181,54,87,210,250,72,162,148,225,19,105,55,253,162,16,151,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
