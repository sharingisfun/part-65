Henry Ossian Flipper, the first black graduate of West Point. Assigned to serve at Fort Davis, Texas in 1881, Flipper became the object of a conspiracy to rid the base of its only black graduate. Flipper, portrayed by Franklyn Seales, was framed by white officers who accused him of embezzling government funds. Ninety-four years later, Flipper was vindicated only a week after &quot;The Trial of the Moke&quot; ended its world premiere run at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater in 1976. A military reburial with honors followed in 1978.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe19afc9c95b6dbf3df8e3737d9db9271f28d83","amp;dn":"The+Trial+of+the+Moke+%281978%29+Alfre+Woodard%2C+Samuel+L.+Jackson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe19afc9c95b6dbf3df8e3737d9db9271f28d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,225,154,252,156,149,182,219,243,223,142,55,55,217,219,146,113,242,141,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
