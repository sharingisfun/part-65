This special edition features the three full length Casebook episodes released so far, which provide over 12 hours of gameplay. The games have been enhanced with new mini-games, a new evidence linking system, a hint system and a ranking system in which you work your way up from a Lab Technician to Forensic Expert. Statistics show how much of the available evidence you have found, divided into two categories: Hard Evidence which is essential to the case and Other Evidence which is optional. The mini-games can be skipped, but doing so lowers the final score, as does using the hints system.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Download the game;\n2) Mount or burn disc image;\n3) Run Casebook_Trilogy_Setup.exe to install (it will start automatically if you have autorun enabled);\n4) Play the game without the disc.\n\n! Notice\nA prequel to the trilogy can be downloaded for free from the developer's website: Episode 0 - The Missing Urn.\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90e71b87f38099cdc93f842b0b516945fdda2786","amp;dn":"Casebook+Trilogy+Special+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90e71b87f38099cdc93f842b0b516945fdda2786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,231,27,135,243,128,153,205,201,63,132,43,11,81,105,69,253,218,39,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
