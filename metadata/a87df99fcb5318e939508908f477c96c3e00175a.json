Like looking through a\ntelescope at the formation of a new galaxy, the Townhouse Orchestra delivers a\nweighty performance of improvised music.\n\nThe quartet is made up of master British saxophone legend Evan Parker and a\nScandinavian dream team. Bassist Ingebrigt Haker Flaten and drummer Paal\nNilssen-Love have also combined forces in bands including Atomic , The Thing\n(with saxophonist Mats Gustafsson ), and Scorch Trio (with guitarist Raoul\nBjorkenheim). Townhouse Orchestra's fourth member is Sten Sandell, a pianist\nvery familiar with all three of his partners.\n\nRecorded in Oslo, Norway in February 2007, Belle Ville is a follow-up to the\nquartet's debut, Townorchestrahouse (Clean Feed, 2005). Each disc contains a\nsingle lengthy but highly focused improvisation that never falters throughout\nits 45 minutes. Despite the daunting appearance of the track lengths, the\nlistening experience is unfazed.\n\nThe quartet puts on a pageant of sound, displaying Herculean aggregates of power\nbefore instantly shifting into singular soloing without pause or loss of\nmomentum. Much like a painting exhibition of Jackson Pollock or Gerhard\nRichterm, it's possible to stand back and take in the whole of the music, or\nzero in on detail and enjoy its various pieces and parts. Sometimes the whole is\nindeed too much to consume, as this is a monumental work of art.\n\nMore\n====\nby Stef\n\nBy Jason Bivins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/4933&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/4933&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Pachi Tapiz &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2009/07/creando-libremente-en-corto-y-en-largo.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2009/07/creando-libremente-en-corto-y-en-largo.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a87df99fcb5318e939508908f477c96c3e00175a","amp;dn":"Townhouse+Orchestra+-+Belle+Ville+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a87df99fcb5318e939508908f477c96c3e00175a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,125,249,159,203,83,24,233,57,80,137,8,244,119,201,108,62,0,23,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
