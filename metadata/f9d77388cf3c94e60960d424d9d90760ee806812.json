With a \n career spanning 20 years, it might come as a surprise \n to some that 'Nine Lives' is John 00 Flemings first \n solo studio album. John himself admits he's a DJ \n first, hence why it's taken him so long to present \n his debut. Touring the world, producing TV/Movie \n scores, whilst compiling award winning Essential \n mixes and gold selling mix compilations, has all \n taken precious studio time away. 'Nine lives' \n represents a new turning point for him, Fleming being \n a dedicated supporter of the more specialist scene. \n John is going back to his roots, making music solely \n aimed for the dance floor with no care for the \n commercial mainstream. That's where the big \n difference lies. Music with soul. Music with passion. \n Music to represent the artist within.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9d77388cf3c94e60960d424d9d90760ee806812","amp;dn":"John_00_Fleming_-_Nine_Lives-Retail-2011-MYCEL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9d77388cf3c94e60960d424d9d90760ee806812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,215,115,136,207,60,148,230,9,96,212,36,217,217,7,96,238,128,104,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
