During these stress tests and benchmarks, StressLinux monitors the health of the hardware.  It is a live distro, so all you have to do is burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD and boot from it.  It does not have a GUI so you have to be at least a little familiar with command-line.\n\nThis is good for people who are overclocking their computers, or want to test unstable software.  If a computer can handle the load forced upon it while running StressLinux, it will be able to handle anything on its native OS.  This runs on 64-bit computers only.\n\n\n\nSOFTWARE INCLUDED IN STRESSLINUX:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n BASIS DISTRIBUTION:\n\n  busybox\n  supportutils (modified version for stresslinux)\n\n\n TESTING AND MONITORING:\n\n  stress\n  stressapptest\n  CPU burn\n  nbench\n  tiobench\n  mprime\n  hddtemp\n  lm_sensors\n  lshw\n  bonnie++\n  netio\n  nepim\n  netperf\n  iperf\n  smartmontools\n  x86info\n  memtester\n  bandwidth\n  memtest86\n  memtest86+\n  ramspeed\n  y-cruncher\n  tw_cli\n  arecacli\n  hpacucli\n  megacli\n  mpt-status\n  lsiutil\n  sas2ircu\n\n\n RESCUE AND RECOVERY:\n\n  dd\n  dd_rescue\n  pcopy\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:099b7b76d32fa7c632fb116cd8042f838beff9f8","amp;dn":"StressLinux+v0.7.106+%2864-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"099b7b76d32fa7c632fb116cd8042f838beff9f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,155,123,118,211,47,167,198,50,251,17,108,216,4,47,131,139,239,249,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
