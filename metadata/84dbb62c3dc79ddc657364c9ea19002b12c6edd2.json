It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84dbb62c3dc79ddc657364c9ea19002b12c6edd2","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+12+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84dbb62c3dc79ddc657364c9ea19002b12c6edd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,219,182,44,61,199,157,220,101,115,100,201,234,25,0,43,18,198,237,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
