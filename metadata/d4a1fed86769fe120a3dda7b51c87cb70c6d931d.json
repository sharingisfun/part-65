The only advert for the software appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and only appears every so many minutes.  Most of the time I don't even notice it when I watch my conversion.\n\nThis episode of The True Story is about how much of what was shown in The Bourne Identity was real.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4a1fed86769fe120a3dda7b51c87cb70c6d931d","amp;dn":"History.Channel.The.True.Story.The.Bourne.Identity.480p.HDTV.x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4a1fed86769fe120a3dda7b51c87cb70c6d931d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,161,254,216,103,105,254,18,10,61,218,123,81,200,124,183,12,109,147,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
