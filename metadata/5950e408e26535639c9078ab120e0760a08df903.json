Please seed! I figure if you've found this then you already know what this movie is about, but just in case here is the info from IMDB:\n\n     A &quot;Leatherface&quot; type murderer who wears other people's faces, kills at an all-night horrorthon at an old theatre put on by a bunch of film students. Maggie, the lead character, believes it's really Lanyard Gates, a crazed film maker who killed his family live on stage, fifteen years ago. And now he's back to kill his daughter, Sara, who is believed to be really Maggie.\n\n     A group of teenagers preparing an old horror movie show in an abandoned theatre discover a recording made by an actual murderer who died long ago. Very soon a shadowy figure resembling the killer starts stalking them one by one.\n\n\nEnjoy!                   -Red Apathy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5950e408e26535639c9078ab120e0760a08df903","amp;dn":"+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5950e408e26535639c9078ab120e0760a08df903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,80,228,8,226,101,53,99,156,144,120,171,18,14,7,96,160,141,249,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
