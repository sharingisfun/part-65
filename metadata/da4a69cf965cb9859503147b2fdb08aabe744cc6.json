Now, some years on, it's time for a comprehensive recap of the Jaxx' mindblowing A-sides. All fifteen singles are here, scrambled by the Jaxx into the optimum track order (who really cares about chronology?), and there isn't a dud among them. Selecting highlights is a futile task--just stick the disc on and let your senses be guided from the hypnotic &quot;Red Alert&quot; through the awesome &quot;Where's Your Head At&quot; and beyond &quot;Do Your Thing&quot;'s reinvention of dancehall swing. It's quite a trip.\nThe second disc on this limited edition of The Singles compiles some notable rarities as well as reworkings of the A's on disc one. &quot;Magnificent Romeo&quot; serves up a finely danceable disco rendition of Rooty's opener--it's all in the bassline. Elsewhere, the Latin and acoustic edits of &quot;Rendez-vu&quot; and &quot;Broken Dreams&quot; are particularly tasty, while &quot;The Isley Bootleg&quot; cut of &quot;Jus 1 Kiss&quot; adds a touch of Daft Punk to that classic track. The second disc is a fine companion to the first and, its own way, just as dynamic.\n\nFor those who have followed Basement Jaxx from Remedy through Rooty to Kish Kash, there's no doubt that the duo are consistent--weak album tracks are almost non-existent. Cull the lead tracks from that trinity of essential LPs and you have a 'best of' well worthy of its role, a constant high that is about as exhilarating as modern uptempo music gets. These are truly essential recordings.--Jonathan Davies\n\nTrack List:\n\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Red Alert&quot; (featuring Blue James)\t3:37\n2.\t&quot;Good Luck&quot; (featuring Lisa Kekaula)\t3:32\n3.\t&quot;Romeo&quot; (featuring Kele Le Roc)\t3:26\n4.\t&quot;Oh My Gosh&quot; (featuring Vula Malinga)\t3:57\n5.\t&quot;Bingo Bango&quot;  \t3:48\n6.\t&quot;Where's Your Head At?&quot;  \t4:00\n7.\t&quot;Rendez-Vu&quot;  \t3:45\n8.\t&quot;Jump n' Shout&quot; (featuring Slarta John)\t3:39\n9.\t&quot;Lucky Star&quot; (featuring Dizzee Rascal)\t3:54\n10.\t&quot;Plug It In&quot; (featuring JC Chasez)\t3:20\n11.\t&quot;U Don't Know Me&quot; (featuring Lisa Kekaula)\t3:36\n12.\t&quot;Do Your Thing&quot; (featuring Elliot May)\t4:20\n13.\t&quot;Jus 1 Kiss&quot;  \t3:37\n14.\t&quot;Fly Life&quot;  \t4:04\n15.\t&quot;Samba Magic&quot;  \t4:50\n\nSpecial Edition bonus disc:\t\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Magnificent Romeo&quot;  \t4:28\n2.\t&quot;I Beg U&quot;  \t3:42\n3.\t&quot;Mere Pass&quot;  \t4:29\n4.\t&quot;Miracles Keep on Playin' (Red Alert Remix)&quot;  \t4:34\n5.\t&quot;Bongoloid&quot;  \t4:22\n6.\t&quot;Good Luck (Live)&quot;  \t4:53\n7.\t&quot;Rendez-Vu (Latin Version)&quot;  \t4:07\n8.\t&quot;Broken Dreams (Acoustic)&quot;  \t2:42\n9.\t&quot;Ha Choo&quot;  \t2:35\n10.\t&quot;Onyx&quot;  \t4:10\n11.\t&quot;I Live in Camberwell&quot;  \t3:38\n12.\t&quot;Camberskank&quot;  \t5:43\n13.\t&quot;Jus 1 Kiss (The Isley Bootleg)&quot;  \t5:02\n14.\t&quot;Romeo (Acoustic)&quot;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da4a69cf965cb9859503147b2fdb08aabe744cc6","amp;dn":"Basement+Jaxx%3A+The+Singles+%28with+Special+Edition+bonus+disc%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da4a69cf965cb9859503147b2fdb08aabe744cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,74,105,207,150,92,185,133,149,3,20,123,47,219,8,170,190,116,76,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
