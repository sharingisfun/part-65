From humble East End London beginnings, the boy with prodigious soccer skills grew up to be one of the most gifted athletes of his generation as well as a sex symbol and fashion icon. Along the way he married Spice Girl Victoria &quot;Posh&quot; Adams, and together they inhabit a celebrity whirlwind of Diana-esque proportions. In Both Feet on the Ground, David talks candidly about the perils of fame (his wife and son were the targets of a notorious kidnapping plot and he is the subject of almost daily tabloid rumors); the struggle to balance his roles as a devoted husband and besotted father with his globetrotting existence as an international soccer star; the behind-the-scenes stories of his most memorable and heartbreaking (if only he could retake that infamous penalty kick against Portugal in Euro 2004) career moments; the controversy surrounding his first year at Real Madrid after his $41 million transfer from Manchester United, the storied English team he joined as a teenager and led for more than a decade; and, finally, his love of America, where he plans to start a soccer school and perhaps, one day, even play professionally.\n\nBoth Feet on the Ground is David Beckham's own extraordinary story, told by the man who knows him best -- David Beckham.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7cad14c272f7a9d4792bbd1b5d89261b04920c9","amp;dn":"Beckham+-+Both+feet+on+the+Ground+%3A+An+Autobiography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7cad14c272f7a9d4792bbd1b5d89261b04920c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,202,209,76,39,47,122,157,71,146,187,209,181,216,146,97,176,73,32,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
