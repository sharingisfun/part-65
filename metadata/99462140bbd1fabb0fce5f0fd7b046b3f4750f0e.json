It soon becomes apparent that they will not have to cope only with the forces of nature, but with the island\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s secrets, including the Dharma Initiative, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Lost Numbers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;others\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (or hostiles) and the strange black smoke- to name a few. There is also much more than meets the eye, as it becomes apparent that everyone is connected in some way and that everyone has a purpose to live on the island... and for some, to die.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve noticed there were no other uploads with the Lost series in portable format. So I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve encoded the whole load in .m4v format.\n\nDownload, seed, and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99462140bbd1fabb0fce5f0fd7b046b3f4750f0e","amp;dn":"Lost+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6+m4v+format+-+by+Freebs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99462140bbd1fabb0fce5f0fd7b046b3f4750f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,70,33,64,187,209,250,187,15,206,95,15,215,176,70,179,244,117,15,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
