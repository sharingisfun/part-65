Arsene Wenger's side have lost on three out of their last four visits there, and have traditionally found it hard to cope with Stoke's physical style. Last season, the Gunners possessed the best away record in the Premier League when they travelled to the Potteries, but were easily beaten 3-1 by Tony Pulis's side.\n\nBeleaguered Liverpool had a tricky trip to play Norwich at Carrow Road. The Canaries forced a draw at Anfield earlier in the season, and have proved tough to beat at home in what has been an excellent return to the Premier League for Paul Lambert's side.\n\nElsewhere, Everton hosted Fulham, Wolves took on Swansea at the Liberty Stadium, Sunderland faced Bolton and Wigan welcomed Newcastle to the DW Stadium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f0018fecca6eb0c5151149762c3a54e860386d","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+28.04.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f0018fecca6eb0c5151149762c3a54e860386d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,240,1,143,236,202,110,176,197,21,17,73,118,44,58,84,232,96,56,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
