But what i want to pay attention       \n    here, is I did a proper rerip from another company dvd source, with      \n    srestore, im pretty happy to give you people a perfect dvdrip. So,       \n    how .. eh, about 5y late? This is how much i care about nukers nuking    \n    a working release. You won't see a .repack. or shit from me within a     \n    week from nuke, thats for sure. Thinking about older pre of this,        \n    it's not dubbed, but the original theatrical italian was a dubbed        \n    one, that was the italian way back then, and that got into iMDb too.     \n                                                                             \n    Nuke FiCO or nuke not, we are not going to stop.
