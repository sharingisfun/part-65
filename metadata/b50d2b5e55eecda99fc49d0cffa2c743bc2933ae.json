Night Shyamalan returns to the summer box office landscape that served as the backdrop for his cinematic breakthrough. In Signs, another paranormal outing for the writer-director, Shyamalan explores the eerie implications of a 500-foot crop circle that mysteriously appears on the Bucks County, PA farm of reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). As Hess and his family (Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) try to take stock of what the sign means, and how its message incorporates into their faith, they start to get the feeling they are not alone in the fields behind their house. Shyamalan re-teams with producers Frank Marshall, Sam Mercer and Kathleen Kennedy, and produces the project in association with his Blinding Edge Pictures banner and Touchstone Pictures. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 46 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 400\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50d2b5e55eecda99fc49d0cffa2c743bc2933ae","amp;dn":"Signs%282002%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50d2b5e55eecda99fc49d0cffa2c743bc2933ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,13,43,94,85,238,205,169,159,196,157,12,255,162,199,67,188,41,51,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
