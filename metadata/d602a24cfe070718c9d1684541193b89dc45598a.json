Like naturally occurring diamond it is composed of a three-dimensional carbon crystal. Due to its extreme physical properties, synthetic diamond is used in many industrial applications, such as drill bits and scratch-proof coatings, and has the potential to be used in many new application areas\n\nA brand new title from the respected Wiley Materials for Electronic and Optoelectronic Applications series, this title is the most up-to-date resource for diamond specialists. Beginning with an introduction to the properties of diamond, defects, impurities and the growth of CVD diamond with its imminent commercial impact, the remainder of the book comprises six sections: introduction, radiation sensors, active electronic devices, biosensors, MEMs and electrochemistry. Subsequent chapters cover the diverse areas in which diamond applications are having an impact including electronics, sensors and actuators and medicine.\nAbout the Author\nDr. Ricardo Sussmann is a technical consultant and a senior research fellow in the solid-state group of the physics department at King's College London (UK). He is the former head of R&amp;D at DeBeers Industrial Diamond Division. His research areas include processing of electronic components and characterization, synthesis and growth of inorganic semiconductors. He has published numerous papers in well-known scientific journals and has obtained numerous patents on ideas related to CVD diamond. He is on the committee of the annual European Diamond Conference.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 596 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (March 17, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 047006532X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470065327","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d602a24cfe070718c9d1684541193b89dc45598a","amp;dn":"CVD+Diamond+for+Electronic+Devices+and+Sensors%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d602a24cfe070718c9d1684541193b89dc45598a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,2,162,76,254,7,7,24,201,209,104,69,65,25,59,137,220,69,89,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
