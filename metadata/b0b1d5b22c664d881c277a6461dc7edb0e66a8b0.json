Right?\n\nWell, to be honest, with all of Robocopy's powerful features it can prove to be extremely daunting for the average or even seasoned computer user or admin. If you have ever watched someone using a command line interface (AKA DOS Window) to perform tasks it can seem complicated to say the least.\n\nTo fully exploit the power of Robocopy you need to memorize a lexicon of command line switches.\n\n \n\nEnter CopyRite XP.\n\nCopyRite XP creates a friendly user interface or GUI with which the user can easily and quickly configure RoboCopy to use any or all of its features by pointing and clicking CopyRite's settings. Check out the screenshots for what we mean.\n\nWithin minutes you can have CopyRite XP installed and configured to run your fist job whether it be copying all of you precious pictures to a USB drive for safe keeping or migrating an entire file server to a new server.\n\n \n\nIf you stop the job or you lose connection in the middle of copying a large file don't worry. You won't have to wait for the entire file to copy all over again because Robocopy is smart enough to know what it has already copied and can resume copying a large file right where it left off.\n\nI'm getting tired of all this typing so that's all for now.\n\n \n\nTry it and you'll see.\n\n \n\nGuarnteed compatible with 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows including XP, 2000, Vista, 7, Server (2003, 2008, 2008 R2).\n\n100% Money Back Stisfaction Guaranteed.\n\nIf you like it buy it please\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b1d5b22c664d881c277a6461dc7edb0e66a8b0","amp;dn":"CopyRite+XP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b1d5b22c664d881c277a6461dc7edb0e66a8b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,177,213,178,44,102,77,136,28,39,122,100,97,220,126,219,14,102,168,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
