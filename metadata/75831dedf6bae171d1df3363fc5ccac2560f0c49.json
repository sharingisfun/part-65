How does the domino effect relate to the credit crunch? When can mathematics help explain marriage? And how on earth do toads predict earthquakes? The future is uncertain. But science can help foretell what lies ahead.\nDrawing on ecology and biology, math and physics, Crashes, Crises, and Calamities offers four fundamental tools that scientists and engineers use to forecast the likelihood of sudden change: stability, catastrophe, complexity, and game theories. In accessible prose, Len Fisher demonstrates how we can foresee and manage events that might otherwise catch us by surprise.\n\nAt the cutting edge of science, Fisher helps us find ways to act before a full-fledged catastrophe is upon us. Crashes, Crises, and Calamities is a witty and informative exploration of the chaos, complexity, and patterns of our daily lives.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75831dedf6bae171d1df3363fc5ccac2560f0c49","amp;dn":"Crashes%2C+Crises%2C+and+Calamities%3A+How+We+Can+Use+Science+to+Read+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75831dedf6bae171d1df3363fc5ccac2560f0c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,131,29,237,246,186,225,113,209,223,51,99,252,92,202,194,86,15,12,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
