Sharp-eyed raptors use binocular and even ultra-violet vision to stalk their victims. Owls home in on a kill even in complete darkness with highly-developed hearing, responsible for the signature shape of their faces. Vultures search for carcasses and have keen long-distance senses of smell and dynamic digestive systems. Innovative experiments used by naturalists and scientists are also on display in this installment of the much-loved Discovery series, The Ultimate Guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c7c6d5e3333e707a30260c411d6fd63892401f","amp;dn":"Discovery.The.Ultimate.Guide.Birds.of.Prey.DivX.AC3.MVGroup.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c7c6d5e3333e707a30260c411d6fd63892401f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,199,198,213,227,51,62,112,122,48,38,12,65,29,111,214,56,146,64,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
