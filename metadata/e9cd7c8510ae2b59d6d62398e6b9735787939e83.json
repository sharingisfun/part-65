Information capture has forced storage capacity from megabytes to terabytes, exabytes and, pretty soon, zetabytes of data. So the need for accessible storage space for this data is great. To make this huge amount of data usable and relevant, it needs to be organized effectively. Database Base Management Systems, such as Oracle, IBM's DB2, and Microsoft SqlServer are used often, but these are being enhanced continuously and auxiliary tools are being developed every week; there needs to be a fundamental starting point for it all. That stating point is Data Architecture, the blueprint for organizing and structuring of information for services, service providers, and the consumers of that data. \n\nData Architecture: From Zen to Reality explains the principles underlying data architecture, how data evolves with organizations, and the challenges organizations face in structuring and managing their data. It also discusses proven methods and technologies to solve the complex issues dealing with data. The book uses a holistic approach to the field of data architecture by covering the various applied areas of data, including data modelling and data model management, data quality , data governance, enterprise information management, database design, data warehousing, and warehouse design. This book is a core resource for anyone emplacing, customizing or aligning data management systems, taking the Zen-like idea of data architecture to an attainable reality. \n\n\n\n[img]http://shareimage.ro/images/rr5ufk86mc36xixy05ga.jpg[/img]\nCyber Warfare Techniques Tactics and Tools for Security Practitioners 2011 RETAiL EBook-DiGiBook\n\nCyber Warfare explores the battlefields, participants and the tools and techniques used during today's digital conflicts.

In Joe Celko's SQL for Smarties: Advanced SQL Programming, he picks up where basic SQL training and experience leaves many database professionals and offers tips, techniques, and explanations that help readers extend their capabilities to top-tier SQL programming. \nAlthough Celko denies that the book is about database theory, he nevertheless alludes to theory often to buttress his practical points. This title is not for novices, as the author points out. Instead, its intended audience is SQL programmers with at least a year's experience. The book maintains a fine balance between technical discussion and practical explanation--picking hot topics and offering advice on a wide range of issues. \n\nThe book uses ANSI SQL-89 as its baseline standard, with some mention of SQL-92 features. It does not, however, focus on any commercial product; this guide zeroes in on the SQL language. Celko covers all aspects of database design, optimization, and manipulation, with easy-to-understand explanations of key issues such as why not to use too many nulls, how to use practical normalization, and how to optimize queries. \n\nThis insightful text is manna for all the day-to-day SQL coders banging their heads over the language's subtle challenges. --Stephen W. Plain \n\nTopics covered: Database design and normalization, SQL data types, querying, grouping, set operations, optimization, data scaling, and encoding. --This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition. \n\n\n\n[img][/img]\n3C Vision Cues Context and Channels 2011 RETAiL EBook-DiGiBook\n\nThe exponential explosion of images and videos concerns everybody's common life, since this media is now present everywhere and in all human activities. Scientists, artists and engineers, in any field, need to be aware of the basic mechanisms that allow them to understand how images are essentially information carriers. Images bear a strong evocative power, because their perception quickly brings into mind a number of related pictorial contents of past experiences, and even of abstract concepts like pleasure, attraction or aversion. \n\nThis book analyzes the visual hints, thanks to which, images are generally interpreted, processed and exploited, both by humans and computer programs. \n\nComprehensive introductory text \n\nIntroduces the reader to the large world of imagery on which many human activities are based, from politics to entertainment, from technical reports to artistic creations \n\nProvides a unified framework where both biological and artificial vision are discussed through visual cues, through the role of contexts and the available multi-channels to deliver information.\n\n\n\n[img]http://shareimage.ro/images/vg8elg7tyj035l2za22.jpg[/img]\nReinventing the Postal Sector in an Electronic Age 2011 RETAiL EBook-DiGiBook\n\nThis compilation of original essays by an international cast of public sector economists and industry practitioners analyzes some of the major issues now facing postal and delivery services throughout the world as competition from information and communications technologies has increased. Competition has become increasingly important in the postal sector for some time in the form of alternative entrants providing mail delivery. However, the competition from information and communications technologies (ICT) in the form of email and instant messaging, the Internet, Facebook and other forms of social networking and portable wireless devises such as the iPad and Kindle may be even more significant. Mail volumes are falling and the economies of scale that have made possible daily deliveries to every address are being eroded. This book assesses volume these declines resulting from this so-called 'eSubstituion' and looks at the ways the postal sector can adapt to the rapid changes resulting from ICT. The impact of electronic invoicing on transactions mail, and the impact on bulk mail of electronic forms of advertising are examined. Strategies, including pricing and access policies, are discussed in the context of the increasing impact of ICT. A rethinking of the role of mail in an electronic age is taking place and this book provides the cutting-edge of this rethinking and the attempts of POs to reinvent themselves while continuing to meet the public's expectation of continuing ubiquitous daily deliveries of traditional mail products. Undergraduate and postgraduate students and researchers in regulation, competition law, innovation and public sector economics along with institutional libraries and industry professionals will find this volume informative and useful.\n\n\n\n[img]http://shareimage.ro/images/0tyj1lszfv0so9xh2cds.jpg[/img]\nThe Image Processing Handbook 2011 RETAiL EBook-DiGiBook\n\nWhether obtained by microscopes, space probes, or the human eye, the same basic tools can be applied to acquire, process, and analyze the data contained in images. Ideal for self study, The Image Processing Handbook, Sixth Edition, first published in 1992, raises the bar once again as the gold-standard reference on this subject. Using extensive new illustrations and diagrams, it offers a logically organized exploration of the important relationship between two-dimensional images and the three-dimensional structures they reveal. \n\n\nProvides Hundreds of Visual Examples in FULL COLOR! \n\nThe author focuses on helping readers visualize and compare processing and measurement operations and how they are typically combined in fields ranging from microscopy and astronomy to real-world scientific, industrial, and forensic applications. Presenting methods in the order in which they would be applied in a typical workflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from acquisition to interpretationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this book compares a wide range of algorithms used to: \nImprove the appearance, printing, and transmission of an image \n\nPrepare images for measurement of the features and structures they reveal \n\nIsolate objects and structures, and measure their size, shape, color, and position \n\nCorrect defects and deal with limitations in images \n\nEnhance visual content and interpretation of details \n\nThis handbook avoids dense mathematics, instead using new practical examples that better convey essential principles of image processing. This approach is more useful to develop readersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ grasp of how and why to apply processing techniques and ultimately process the mathematical foundations behind them. \n\n\nMuch more than just an arbitrary collection of algorithms, this is the rare book that goes beyond mere image improvement, presenting a wide range of powerful example images that illustrate techniques involved in color processing and enhancement. Applying his 50-year experience as a scientist, educator, and industrial consultant, John Russ offers the benefit of his image processing expertise for fields ranging from astronomy and biomedical research to food science and forensics. His valuable insights and guidance continue to make this handbook a must-have reference.
