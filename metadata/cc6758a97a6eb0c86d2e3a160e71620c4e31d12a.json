What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 6 - Monday - Greek salad is not as simple as it seems, particularly when it's been created by George! The three contestants in tonight's elimination challenge have three and a half hours to cook. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc6758a97a6eb0c86d2e3a160e71620c4e31d12a","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E32.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc6758a97a6eb0c86d2e3a160e71620c4e31d12a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,103,88,169,122,110,176,200,109,46,58,22,14,113,98,12,78,49,209,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
