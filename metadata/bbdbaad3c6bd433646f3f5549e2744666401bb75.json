Lunsford's years of experience in the classroom and in the field have given her a unique understanding of how, what, where, and why today's students write. For her research for &quot;The St. Martin's Handbook&quot; -- ongoing for over two decades -- she has studied thousands of papers by composition students nationwide. Andrea Lunsford's trademark attention to rhetorical choice, language and style, and critical thinking and argument have always made &quot;The St. Martin's Handbook&quot; an accessible and thorough writing resource. Now informed by new research into student writing patterns and featuring expanded and more visual coverage of research, documentation, and writing in any discipline, &quot;The St. Martin's Handbook&quot; offers students more help than ever before with meeting the expectations of college work. \n\n\n\n\n*Media: Hardcover Book, 1056 pages\n\t\n*Language: English\n\n*Publisher: Bedford Books (Jun. 30th, 2009)\n\n*ISBN-10: 0312594542\n\t\n*ISBN-13: 9780312594541","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbdbaad3c6bd433646f3f5549e2744666401bb75","amp;dn":"The+St+Martins+Handbook+6th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbdbaad3c6bd433646f3f5549e2744666401bb75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,219,170,211,198,189,67,54,70,243,245,84,158,39,68,102,100,1,187,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
