In the US however, he was seen as very much yesterday's man. Escaping the clutches of his notorious manager Don Arden, Gene made tracks to Hollywood into the open arms of 4 Star Records and Music, a happening hive of music.\n\nThis CD documents their efforts to reinvent Gene as an LA folk/country rocker, with a slew of beautiful songs almost on a par with The Gosdin BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ seminal The Sounds Of Goodbye or The International Submarine Band's debut. In great voice and expertly backed by LA session giants such as Glen Campbell and The Champs, and generating hits in Ã¢â‚¬ËœBird DogginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBorn To Be A Rollin' StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, this collection shows an amazing direction Gene's career could have taken.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12885a82757431f2ebed0680f0c290a32e9b05a4","amp;dn":"gene+vincent+born+to+be+a+rollin%27+stone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12885a82757431f2ebed0680f0c290a32e9b05a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,136,90,130,117,116,49,242,235,237,6,128,240,194,144,163,46,155,5,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
