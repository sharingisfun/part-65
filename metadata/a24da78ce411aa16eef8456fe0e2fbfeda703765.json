Our speakers will draw upon many decades of research to help you connect the dots that are pointing us towards an Orwellian police stateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½indeed, to a much darker future than most citizens can even imagine. Our wide-ranging roster of presenters, including David Ray Griffin, Jim Marrs and Ellen Brown, will delve into the roots of our current crises and the dynamics driving despotic governance, financial plunder, imperialism, loss of civil liberties, and assaults on public health. Further, they will explore how such vital insights are continually being suppressed as they expose the media matrix that obscures these facts and stupefies our culture, all in the interest of protecting a malignant status quo.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://understandingdeeppolitics.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://understandingdeeppolitics.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a24da78ce411aa16eef8456fe0e2fbfeda703765","amp;dn":"Understanding+Deep+Politics+2010+-+Ian+R.+Crane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a24da78ce411aa16eef8456fe0e2fbfeda703765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,77,167,140,228,17,170,22,238,248,69,111,224,226,251,254,218,112,55,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
