Leaves fall, and spirits rise from the fallen leaves to begin their journey home. You must guide them, without direct control, by changing how the wind blows or by rebuilding the ground. Each spirit can be sacrificed to perform one of four actions - build a bridge of leaves, create a blowing cloud, dig tunnels, or block wind currents in an area. Use your actions wisely or you will run out of spirits. In each level it's up to you to find your own creative solution on how to get the spirits to the goal.\n\n\nPRAISE AND AWARDS FOR iOS VERSION\n\n&quot;Striking art and innovative gameplay&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œThe Escapist\n\n&quot;When the wind physics start to do their thing, the experience is pretty magical.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œMike Schramm, tuaw.com\n\n&quot;Spirits is clever, challenging, and beautiful&quot; \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œGamasutra\n\n&quot;There are a number of titles out there that really ooze that special 'indie magic', and Spirits is one of them.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œTouchArcade\n\n&quot;Gorgeous visuals; ambient music; solid level design&quot; \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œSlide To Play\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Winner of the IndieCade Best Aesthetics AwardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Culver City, California, USA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2010\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IGF Best Mobile Game Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Honorable MentionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ San Francisco, USA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2011\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Indie Game Challenge FinalistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Las Vegas, USA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2011\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sense of Wonder Night SelectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Tokyo, Japan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2010\n\n\nVIDEO &amp; SUPPORT\n\nVisit www.spacesofplay.com/spirits to watch a gameplay video.\n\nThe game supports any resolution natively up to 2560Ãƒâ€”1440 pixels, making it look stunning both on a 11&quot; MacBook Air and a 27&quot; iMac alike.
