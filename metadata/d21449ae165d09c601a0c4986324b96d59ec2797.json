So expect VHS quality, and some of those tapes held up well. The video is pretty good on a lot of them, and average on a few.\n\nThis was the first year after the original cast and Executive Producer / co-creater Lorne Michaels left. Lorne's associate producer for the first 5 years Jean Doumanian took over, much to NBC's regret. She later became Woody Allen's movie producer for many years until they eventually parted ways.\n\n1980-early 81 was a troubled season that had its share of bad writing (which is probably why a 6th Season SNL DVD set was never released) and some people in that cast never became famous. But there are some gems mixed in as well, with Joe Piscopo, Weekend Update anchored by Charles Rocket (later joined by regular Gail Matthius), The Rocket Report -- and the emergence of Eddie Murphy from featured player in the 3rd show in November 1980 to cast member by January).
