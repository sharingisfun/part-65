The band consisted of Tyme on lead vocals, keyboards, and percussion; Anthony Izzo on vocals and lead guitar; William Brancaccio on rhythm guitar, vocals, and keyboards; Steve Ciantro on bass; and Allen Cooley on drums and vocals. In 1969 the band released their only album for the Enterprise label, titled First Time from Memphis. Falling somewhere between Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother and the Holding Company style of music, the band failed to establish their own identity. Despite their songwriting competence and energetic performance on the 11 songs on this album, January Tyme faded into rock obscurity.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec5add7b595958b98c4a798947e3730ff83c052","amp;dn":"January+Tyme+-+First+time+From+Memphis+%281970%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec5add7b595958b98c4a798947e3730ff83c052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,197,173,215,181,149,149,139,152,196,167,152,148,126,55,48,255,131,192,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
