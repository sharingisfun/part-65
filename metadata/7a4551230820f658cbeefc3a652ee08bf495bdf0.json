Shortly after starting work, she decided to write a blog about her experiences. Since some clients thought she looked like a surfer she adopted the name &quot;Surfistinha&quot; which means little surfer girl. This blog became a sensation, and quickly became one of the most popular blogs in Brazil. Becoming famous, her life changed significantly. She went on to be interviewed on Brazilian talk shows similar to Oprah and David Letterman, all the while continuing her blog about her racy exploits. She wrote a book about these experiences: &quot;O Doce Veneno Do EscorpiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o&quot;. \n\n\n\nRELEASE DATE....: 07/16/2011\nTHEATRE DATE....: 2011\n\n\nGENRE...........: Drama \nSOURCE .........: Bruna Surfistinha 2011 BluRay 1080p AVC DTS-HD MA 5.1-ZMG\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 L4.1 High @ 11131 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\nAUDiO ..........: PORT DTS-HDMA core 5.1CH 1510kbps\nRUNTiME.........: 01:47:37 (h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.850 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1920 X 1040\nSUBTiTLES.......: N/A\nFilE SiZE.......: 9.5G\nENCODER.........: justinsung@CHD\n\n\n\nEnglish Subtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://subscene.com/english/Bruna-Surfistinha-Little-Surfer-Girl/subtitle-449407.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://subscene.com/english/Bruna-Surfistinha-Little-Surfer-Girl/subtitle-449407.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a4551230820f658cbeefc3a652ee08bf495bdf0","amp;dn":"Bruna.Surfistinha.2011.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a4551230820f658cbeefc3a652ee08bf495bdf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,69,81,35,8,32,246,88,203,238,252,58,101,46,224,139,244,149,189,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
