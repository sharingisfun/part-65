He loves telling tall tales and always brags about himself. According to him, he was picked up by a human couple who owns a diner while he was drifting around on an iceberg. \n\nThough he has lost all contact with his Canadian family, he has discovered a new home in serving the diners' clientele, thanks to the kind couple. His cafÃƒÂ© is an embodiment of his personality. The place is always packed with many regulars, animals and humans, who are drawn by his charismatic magnetism. \n\n\n\nRelease date       : April 26, 2012\n\n\nAudio language     : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language  : English\n\n\nStatus             : Currently Airing\n\n\nProducers          : Studio Pierrot\n\n\nGenres             : Comedy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c40afee7f72fa96d1b5a5f584935801f344efb","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Polar+Bear+Cafe+-+04+%5B480p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c40afee7f72fa96d1b5a5f584935801f344efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,196,10,254,231,247,47,169,109,27,90,95,88,73,53,128,31,52,78,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
