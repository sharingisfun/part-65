What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 8 - Friday - George, Matt Moran and Gary showcase the best food Kangaroo Island has to offer. Expect tips on cooking with lamb, marron and chicken. Then we end the night with a taste of honey. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0594c45293f18922f0e79d862a2b6ae3b3c9d77b","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E48.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0594c45293f18922f0e79d862a2b6ae3b3c9d77b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,148,196,82,147,241,137,34,240,231,157,134,42,43,106,227,179,201,215,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
