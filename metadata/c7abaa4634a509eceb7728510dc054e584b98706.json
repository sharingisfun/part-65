Windows routinely allocates memory to applications, games and system processes; over time the memory becomes completely used handling all of these tasks.\n\n\n\nWith SuperRam, memory management is tuned to maintain computer stability but a greater emphasis is placed on computer performance. Once installed SuperRam begins to monitor the total amount of memory your computer has installed, it also monitors when your computer reaches a threshold of memory to maintain, when that threshold is reached SuperRam immediately will release all memory that it determines can be released on the computer system back to Windows.\n\nWhen SuperRam is installed any new application, program or game that is opened will use physical memory installed on the computer and placing applications that you opened previously to use virtual memory. This allows software to run with an emphasis on performance when performance is needed; such as when playing games, editing photos/videos, using processor and memory intensive applications.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7abaa4634a509eceb7728510dc054e584b98706","amp;dn":"PGWARE+SuperRam+6.9.19.2011+with+KEYGEN+%2B+PATCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7abaa4634a509eceb7728510dc054e584b98706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,171,170,70,52,165,9,236,235,119,40,81,13,192,84,229,132,185,135,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
