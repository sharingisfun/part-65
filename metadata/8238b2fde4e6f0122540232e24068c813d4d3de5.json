He, along with newcomers Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, Jan Hooks, and Victoria Jackson, helped to reverse the show's declining popularity and made SNL &quot;must-see&quot; TV once again. An important part of the show's revival was Carvey's breakout character, The Church Lady, the uptight, smug, and pious host of Church Chat.[5] Carvey said he based the character on women he knew from church while growing up, who would keep track of other churchgoers' attendance. He became so associated with the character that later cast members like Chris Farley referred to Carvey simply as &quot;The Lady.&quot;\n\nCarvey's other original characters included Garth Algar (from &quot;Wayne's World&quot;), Hans (from &quot;Hans and Franz&quot;), and The Grumpy Old Man (from Weekend Update appearances).\n\nDuring the 1992 US presidential election campaign, Carvey did an impression of independent candidate Ross Perot; in a prime-time special before the election, Carvey played both George H. W. Bush and Perot in a three-way debate with Bill Clinton, played by Phil Hartman. As PerotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½prerecorded and timed to give the appearance of interacting with the live Bush and ClintonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Carvey eschewed the show's signature &quot;Live from New York&quot; opening line, telling Bush &quot;Why don't you do it, live-boy?&quot; Carvey left SNL in 1993 but almost rejoined the cast in 1994, before the show's 20th season.\n\nIn 1992, Carvey joined Mike Myers in Wayne's World, the movie. A sequel, Wayne's World 2, was filmed and released in 1993.\nCarvey's SNL work won him an Emmy in 1993 for &quot;Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.&quot; He has a total of six Emmy nominations. Carvey has returned to host SNL four times, in 1994, 1996, 2000, and 2011.\n\nAfter SNL\n\nNBC executives hoped to get Carvey to take over the 12:30 a.m. (ET) weeknight spot in the network's lineup in 1993 when David Letterman left his show, Late Night with David Letterman, for an 11:30 p.m. (ET) show on CBS. A big Letterman fan, Carvey rejected the offer, causing embarrassment for the network, which had publicly floated his name.[citation needed] The 12:30 spot eventually went to Conan O'Brien.\n\nIn 1994, Carvey starred in the film Clean Slate. The following year, in 1995, Carvey filmed his first HBO stand-up special, Critic's Choice. The show featured Carvey doing many of his SNL impersonations, as well as making fun of the premium channel's name, pronouncing it &quot;hobo.&quot;\n\nHe reprised many of his SNL characters in 1996 for The Dana Carvey Show, a short-lived prime-time variety show on ABC. The show was most notable for launching Robert Smigel's cartoon &quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot; as well as the careers of Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert.\n\nIn 2002, he returned to films in the comedy The Master of Disguise, which was panned by critics but managed about $40 million at the North American box office. Carvey has not appeared in a feature film since.\nHe is number 90 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time.\n\nCarvey eventually withdrew from the limelight to focus on his family. He later said in an interview that he does not want to be in a career in which his kids would already be grown with him having neglected spending time with them.\nAt the January 2, 2007 funeral of Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush reminisced in his eulogy about how Ford took it in stride when SNL's Chevy Chase made Ford the object of impressions. Bush cited this as a valuable lesson in learning to laugh at one's self as a part of public life. &quot;I'd tell you more about that,&quot; Bush continued, &quot;but as Dana Carvey would say, [imitating Carvey imitating him] 'Not gonna do it! Wouldn't be prudent!'&quot;.\n\nCarvey made an appearance at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards, reprising his SNL character Garth Algar with host Mike Myers for a Wayne's World sketch. On June 14, 2008, Carvey filmed a second HBO stand-up special, the first in 13 years, entitled Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies.\n\nIn 2010, Carvey appeared in the Funny or Die original comedy sketch, &quot;Presidential Reunion.&quot; He played the role of President Bush alongside other current and former SNL president impersonators.\n\nIn early 2010, Carvey and comedian/writer Spike Feresten created and starred together in Spoof, a sketch comedy pilot for Fox. This included a sketch of a trailer for &quot;Darwin&quot;, a mock movie in which he played the evolutionary biologist, as well as a spoof of the hit show Lost. Both of these sketches can be seen on the video website youtube.[8][9] On the animated TV series The Fairly OddParents, Carvey voiced Cosmo's con artist brother, Schnozmo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8238b2fde4e6f0122540232e24068c813d4d3de5","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Dana+Carvey+-+Both+HBO+Specials+%281995+%26amp%3B+200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8238b2fde4e6f0122540232e24068c813d4d3de5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,56,178,253,228,230,240,18,37,64,35,46,36,6,140,129,61,77,61,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
