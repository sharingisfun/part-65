Johnny Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChokerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jackson, is an ex-Shotgun City police detective who lives in his own rendition of hell. His case of Alien Hand Syndrome has manifested into the most psychotic entity on the planet, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stuck working at a deadbeat detective agency, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s engaged in a squalid and involuntary amour with an otherworldly creature that dwells beneath his bathtub. That, believe it or not, is just for starters.\n\nBut thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prospective light at the end of the tunnel: a high-profile con Johnny once put behind bars is at large, and not even the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite has been able to track the sleazebag down. The police department has offered Johnny a deal: put the rogue back in his below regulation-sized cell and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a job for life. However, it comes at a price, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one nobody will see coming. But if you want something, and want it real bad, what would you be willing to do to get it?\n\nChoker is hardboiled detective fiction, but unlike anything youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen before from this well-worn genre. The story is set in a dystopia, where crime is so rampant that the regular police force has been replaced by troops of enhanced officers, who carry brutality licenses, which allow them to violently beat suspects, on the streets in broad daylight. The city is filled with mutants and freaks, and the sex culture has run wild, with sex clubs everywhere, and 2 auto-wanking machines in the middle of the street. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grim, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gritty, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an incredibly compelling backdrop to tell a story against. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great piece of world building by McCool and Templesmith, and sets the tone for the whole story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faeef439c9fe71e8775400b68a6a0307d0ae8531","amp;dn":"Choker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faeef439c9fe71e8775400b68a6a0307d0ae8531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,238,244,57,201,254,113,232,119,84,0,182,138,106,3,7,208,174,133,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
