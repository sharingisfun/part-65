All three also serve as head writers. It premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[3]\n\nThe show is centered on five characters: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, two physicists who work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); Penny, a blonde waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[4][5] Three other supporting characters have also been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard who left the show after season 3; Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's fiancÃƒÂ©e, who is a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; and Amy Farrah Fowler, a neurobiologist who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40eeba4f6c82f2b82fb21bcf0bdf26685f17cba3","amp;dn":"The+Big+Bang+Theory+-+Season+5+480p+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40eeba4f6c82f2b82fb21bcf0bdf26685f17cba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,238,186,79,108,130,242,184,47,178,27,207,11,223,38,104,95,23,203,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
