The movie is exactly the length of a DV Tape and a sub-plot is established by showing bits and pieces of video previously recorded on the tape that is being recorded over. The movie starts as a monster of unknown origin destroys a building. As they go to investigate, parts of the building and the head of the Statue of Liberty come raining down. The movie follows their adventure trying to escape and save a friend, a love interest of the main character.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c872dceced77d6f7283a6eadb4217e14966e45","amp;dn":"CloverField+%28HD%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c872dceced77d6f7283a6eadb4217e14966e45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,200,114,220,236,237,119,214,247,40,58,110,173,180,33,126,20,150,110,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
