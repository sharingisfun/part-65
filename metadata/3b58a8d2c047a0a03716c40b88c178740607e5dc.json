But that is not true. \n\nWhat you don't know, and what the other torrent doesn't tell you, is there is actually ANOTHER program that you need that simply joins the files into one AVI.\n\nFFSJ (this is the one I use)\nHJSplit\n\nGoogle for one of those two programs. It should join up the 001,002,003, etc, files for you. Repeat for CD2.\n\n*No need to do the above steps if you downloaded THIS torrent!*\n\nWithout further ado, here is the uncompressed Justice Served without all the nonsense. 2 AVI files, exactly the same as the other old torrent. \n\n\nLastly, i'm looking for older episodes of Judge Judy (2007-08 and before, but not the ones they air on the weekend afternoons because I have most of those eps. recorded myself for the past 3-4 years! 2005 and prior would be great!\n\nIf you are interested in TRADING plz email me at invy84 [at] gmail.com for details on what I have (I have a lot!), but please include details of what you have to offer!
