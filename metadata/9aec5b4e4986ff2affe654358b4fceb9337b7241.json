An action game with tactical combat and strategic planning. An adventure game that lets you free-roam a vast, procedurally-generated world. A Valley Without Wind defies genre stereotypes. Unlike other procedurally-generated games, you also get a logical progression in difficulty, plus helpful tips and checklists to guide your travels (should you need them).\n\nChoose for yourself how to prepare to face the vastly stronger Overlord. Complete a variety of missions to earn arcane rewards, or roam the wilds to uncover secret missions and stashes of magical loot. Customize your characters with unique combinations of enchants and spells that change how you move, jump, and fight. Or rescue people and bring them back to your settlement, recruiting them to help you in return.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/games/avww-features&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/games/avww-features&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aec5b4e4986ff2affe654358b4fceb9337b7241","amp;dn":"A+valley+without+wind+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aec5b4e4986ff2affe654358b4fceb9337b7241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,236,91,78,73,134,255,42,255,230,84,53,139,79,206,185,51,123,114,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
