Moore interviews a number of people who have been left broke by medical bills even though they were fully insured, and explains how the corporate drive for profits has left numerous people in financial and medical disarray. After hearing that detainees in Guantanamo have access to free health care, Moore assembles a group of World Trade Center rescue workers to travel to Cuba in order to get the medical help they need for ailments they incurred in 2001. Moore's film debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 3 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 400\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac5b7c9cca1afed24aaf85e02719aa7832e7e420","amp;dn":"Sicko%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac5b7c9cca1afed24aaf85e02719aa7832e7e420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,91,124,156,202,26,254,210,74,175,133,224,39,25,170,120,50,231,228,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
