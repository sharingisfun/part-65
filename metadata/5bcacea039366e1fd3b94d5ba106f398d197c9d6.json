The film is divided into three sections which mirror the movements of Henryk Gorekis Symphony No. 3, the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, to which the film is set. The film focuses on a three-day protest in the form of a march, staged by newly returned veterans. Reversing the same path as Paul Reveres famous ride of 1775, the mounted protest sought to bring renewed awareness to a long-fought, losing battle.\n\n-----\n\nSet to Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3, this documentary reflects on the Vietnam War by mixing footage of a protest march organized by the then newly returned Vietnam vets in 1971, together with footage from the war and conversations with political historian Howard Zinn.\n\nmore info: [url]http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/an_unfinished_symphony[/url]\n\nYou can also watch a streaming version of this documentary online here:\n[url]http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/an_unfinished_symphony[/url]\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Specs\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nType: mp4 file\nSize: 231MB\nRuntime: 00:59:08\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 480x360\nAudio: AAC 44100Hz stereo 96Kbps \n\nPlease note that this is a rip from the Youtube link above and the quality is not that great.
