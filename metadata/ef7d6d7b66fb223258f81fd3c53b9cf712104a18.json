LPS boots a thin Linux operating system from a CD or USB flash stick without mounting a local hard drive. Administrator privileges are not required; nothing is installed. The ATSPI Technology Office created the LPS family to address particular use cases. LPS-Public is a safer, general-purpose solution for using web-based applications. The accredited LPS-Remote Access is only for accessing your organization's private network.\n\nLPS Release Notes\nChanges in Version 1.2.2\nMaintenance release, released 16 July 2011\n\nFixed a problem with iMac Radeon video drivers\nFixed problem with trackpad not working on older MacBooks\nRdesktop: enabled compression to improve performance, fixed problem with cursor control keys not working properly\nUpdated NVIDIA display driver to version 275.09.07\nAdded UVC USB Web Camera support\nAdded minicom 2.4 as a serial port terminal emulator under the Communications menu\nMoved end user license agreement forward in the boot process\nUpdated Firefox to 3.6.19\nUpdated DOD Configuration add-on to 1.3.1\nUpdated Gmail S/MIME addon to 0.5.2\nUpdated Flash to 10.3.181.34\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://spi.dod.mil/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://spi.dod.mil/index.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://spi.dod.mil/docs/Hashes.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://spi.dod.mil/docs/Hashes.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : 84b8c7ff529886b820df2f902dced643  LPS-1.2.2_public.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7d6d7b66fb223258f81fd3c53b9cf712104a18","amp;dn":"LPS-1.2.2_public.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7d6d7b66fb223258f81fd3c53b9cf712104a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,125,109,123,102,251,34,50,88,248,31,211,197,59,156,247,18,16,74,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
