Then Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash co-wrote and played on the song &quot;Always On The Run.&quot; He also played on the song &quot;Fields of Joy.&quot; The song &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; was co-written by Sean Ono Lennon.Mama Said became Kravitz's first U.S. Top 40 album, reaching #39 on the Billboard 200, and going on to sell 1.88 million copies in the US (as of November, 2002). Although the album has sold enough copies to be certified double platinum, the RIAA still has it listed as platinum. In the UK, the album was a big success, reaching #8 on the UK Album Chart. The album sold over 3 million copies worldwide and established Kravitz's popularity into the worldwide market two years after his debut album Let Love Rule.\n\nAlbum Title: Mama Said \nArtist | Group: Lenny Kravitz \nLabel: Virgin records \nRelease date: 1991 \nGenre: Funk rock \nNumber of track(s): 15 \nFile format: mp3 \nTotal duration: 00h:57m:27s:555ms \nTotal size: 132.7735 MB\n\nTrack List:\n\nFields Of Joy\nAlways On The Run\nStand By My Woman\nIt Ain't Over `Til It's Over\nMore Than Anything In This World \nWhat Goes Around Comes Around \nThe Difference Is Why\nStop Draggin' Around\nFlowers for Zoe\nFields Of Joy (Reprise)\nAll I Ever Wanted\nWhen The Morning Turns To Night\nWhat The Fuck Are We Saying?\nButterfly\nAlways On The Run (Instrumental)\n\nENJOY\nplease seed and leave feedback\nvigoni","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd029aa5d7e9a8b402826bd8f0060e2eef2d0db2","amp;dn":"Lenny+Kravitz+-+Mama+Said+320+kbps+%7Bvigoni%7D+%7BPURE+RG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd029aa5d7e9a8b402826bd8f0060e2eef2d0db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,2,154,165,215,233,168,180,2,130,107,216,240,6,14,46,239,45,13,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
