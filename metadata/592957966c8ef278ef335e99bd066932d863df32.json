Uriah Heep's\nprogressive/art rock/heavy metal fusion's distinctive features have always been massive\nkeyboards sound, strong vocal harmonies and (in the early years) David Byron's operatic\nvocals. Twelve of the band's albums have made it to the UK Albums Chart (Return to Fantasy\nreached 7 in 1975) while of the fifteen Billboard 200 Uriah Heep albums Demons and\nWizards was the most successful (23, 1972).In the late 1970s the band had massive success\nin Germany, where the &quot;Lady in Black&quot; single was a big hit.\n\nUriah Heep's audience declined by the 1980s, to the point where they became essentially a\ncult band in the United Kingdom and United States. The band maintains, though, a significant\nfollowing and performs at arena-sized venues in the Balkans, Germany, Japan, the\nNetherlands, Russia and Scandinavia. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide...\n\n\n\n  01 - Gypsy                             [06:35]\n  02 - Bird Of Prey                      [04:10]\n  03 - Look At Yourself                  [05:07]\n  04 - July Morning                      [10:28]\n  05 - The Wizard                        [02:56]\n  06 - Easy Livin'                       [02:34]\n  07 - Sweet Lorraine                    [04:13]\n  08 - Stealin'                          [04:47]\n  09 - Something Or Nothing              [02:52]\n  10 - Prima Donna                       [04:02]\n  11 - One Way Or Another                [04:37]\n  12 - Wise Man                          [04:38]\n  13 - Carry On                          [03:53]\n  14 - That's The Way That It Is         [04:05]\n  15 - Hold Your Head Up                 [04:27]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:09:31\nTotal Size...........: 163.63 MB\n\n\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592957966c8ef278ef335e99bd066932d863df32","amp;dn":"Uriah+Heep+-+Best+Of+2006+%5BMP3-320-LYRICS%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592957966c8ef278ef335e99bd066932d863df32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,41,87,150,108,142,242,120,239,51,94,153,189,6,105,50,216,99,223,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
