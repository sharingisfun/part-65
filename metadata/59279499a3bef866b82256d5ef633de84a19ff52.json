This show may have been the first time a lot of people had heard the band: in spite of their Grammy award for &quot;Anselma&quot; earlier that year (for Best Mexican-American Performance, one of the few awards Michael Jackson did not win), they would not achieve a great deal of widespread exposure until their work on La Bamba in 1987.
